I hated paying for cable for only to watch a handful of channels.
  
[Comcast/XFinity](http://www.comcast.com/customers/feedback/default.cspx), I will come back when you offer ala carte channels at a fair monthly price!

Below are some pics of the setup. This is legal, just limits your selection. If you totally love cable and watch many channels this isn&#8217;t for you. If you&#8217;re a BooyaGadget type person and have gadgets that stream video from hulu,espn, NAS Servers, windows media center, and netflix then save some money by purchasing an HD Antenna. I get the BIG events like world cup, golf majors, world series, nba finals etc..

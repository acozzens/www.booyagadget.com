    Movie Playing in my truck off of a USB Flash Drive
  </p>

BooyaGadget really loves working with music and video streaming anywhere we go&#8230; I really like being mobile, so I have some features I must have when it comes to vehicles.   This quick video shows you the usb video setup I use in my truck. The key for my setup is to have a video ready Head Unit with USB input. I roll the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JVC-KD-AVX44-Kameleon-Multimedia-Receiver/dp/B0012N9RKS?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969" target="_blank">JVC Kamelion</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=booya-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=B0012N9RKS" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, but you do have options for your budget, if you take some time to search for your features and read some reviews.

  
  
  
  
So, here&#8217;s a quick snippet of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Guy-Harvest-Seth-MacFarlane/dp/B000YOX3HE?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969" target="_blank">Family Guy &#8211; Blue Harvest</a> <img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=booya-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=B000YOX3HE" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />off my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patriot-Xporter-Hi-Speed-Hi-Capacity-PEF64GMNUSB/dp/B001KEEGIM?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969" target="_blank">Patriot Magnum 64GB Usb Thumb drive</a> <img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=booya-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=B001KEEGIM" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />I format my movies for the max resolution for my head unit, and prefer using AVI files.

Note:  It is illegal ( and friggin dangerous like txt messaging ) to drive with the movie playing, please don&#8217;t do it !
NOTE: I had to remove this old video. This is an old article and I no longer have the vehicle any longer to test.

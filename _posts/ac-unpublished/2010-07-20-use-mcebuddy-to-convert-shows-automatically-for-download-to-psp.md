Automation is what makes a Power Users work worthwhile. In this clip I will show you how to take the shows that you record with Windows Media Center and automatically have the converted for streaming around your house or for taking your show on the go.

In this digital age we need flexibility with our media content and programs like MCEbuddy provide us with just that. So now you are no longer strapped to your Media Center Machine to watch TV. Watch on your big LCD or on a plane on your PSPgo. Download the latest episode of your favorite show, while you visit your grandma in Texas or while you are drinking a beer on the beach.

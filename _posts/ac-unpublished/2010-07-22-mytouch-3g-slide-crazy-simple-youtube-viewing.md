I am loving the [T-Mobile myTouch 3G Slide Android](http://amzn.to/2f6xkRZ) already after just an hour !One reason I got this was for improved online video viewing. My BlackBerry Curve struggled a bit in this arena. But the myTouch Slide performs wonderfully. So here is an image and a video showing you how slick the YouTube connection options are.

In this video, I show you 2 quick ways to open YouTube. First is through the applications menu, the second is using the GENIUS mode and verbally commanding &#8220;Open Youtube&#8221;

I cannot wait to test this device even more and really make it dance so subscribe or follow us for more videos and walkthroughs on the TMobile myTouch 3G Slide and other gadgets.

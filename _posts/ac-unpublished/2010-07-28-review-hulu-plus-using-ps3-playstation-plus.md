OK, it is slick.  So are you willing to pay $9.99 per month ? [Hulu Plus](http://www.hulu.com/plus){:target="_blank"} is definitely a service to consider. It looks nice and performs well, and will only get better. So It really depends on your budget, and your TV watching Lifestyle.. I&#8217;m not ready to cancel Netflix yet, but you could return your Cable Provider PVR, which carries a $10-$15 monthly fee. That is another interesting approach if you wanted to try it but were on a budget.

Remember, If you want to roll [Hulu Plus](http://www.hulu.com/plus) on the PS3, you will also need to forkout extra dough for the Playstation Plus membership although that does provide many other benefits.

I will be testing it for a few months to see what shakes out, but I am ultimately waiting for the ability to use HuluPlus on my Android myTouch 3G Slide. That could separate Hulu Plus from the pack. ( unless Netflix unleashes a mobile app first ) Hulu Plus get&#8217;s Hulu&#8217;s foot in the door as we eventually slide away from traditional coax cable, and deeper into internet television like with Netflix and eventually GoogleTV.

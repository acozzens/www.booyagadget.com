I'm heading off to go pre-order a PS3 Move.  
So, I was digging around for some of the games I may also pre-order.

I stumbled across Singstar Dance. &nbsp;I have to admit, I enjoy SingStar, but I&#8217;m not sure if I could take it to the next level of dancing with the wand in my hand&#8230; It&#8217;s probably not a game for me despite my amazing dance moves, but there are definitely some people out there that would consider it. Sure looks like they&#8217;re having fun in the video though :)

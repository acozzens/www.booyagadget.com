Woke up to this little treasure in my inbox. I am a New Release snobso when the 28 delay hit Netflix I bounced to Blockbuster to see theÂ latest releases without waiting another month.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-590" title="Blockbuster Games by Mail" src="http://www.booyagadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Blockbuster-Games-by-Mail-480x330.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="330" />](http://www.booyagadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Blockbuster-Games-by-Mail.jpg)

As a Gamefly sub, who spends way to much on that service I was pleasantly surprised to see that Blockbuster would now offer me Games in my queue at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.
  
So as it stands I have the 2 disc a month plan for $13.99. The 2 discs at home can be any combination of games or movies. I don&#8217;t pay extra for Blu-Ray and I never wait for new releases.
  
Today Blockbuster is allowing games to be placed in the queue, when games start shipping I will give a detailed report.

\*Update\*
  
Just cancelled my &#8220;2 Disc Out&#8221; Gamefly sub. Moved up to the $16.99 &#8220;3 Disc Out&#8221; Blockbuster package. Just saved myself 21 bucks.

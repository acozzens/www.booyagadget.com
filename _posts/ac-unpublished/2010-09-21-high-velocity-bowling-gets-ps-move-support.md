The latest PSN update at the [Playstation Blog](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/09/20/playstation-store-update-157/) has informed us that High Velocity Bowling has received its PS Move support. This comes as no surprise as High Velocity Bowling already had motion controls. This was one of the few games that took advantage of the six-axis PS3 controller. Stay tuned to BooyaGadget for a summary of the changes and what you can expect the next time to head to the HVB Lanes.

[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Limited-Invizimals-Entertainment-Pack-Playstation-3/dp/B003O6N1QC/ref=sr_1_2?s=gateway&ie=UTF8&qid=1285622218&sr=8-2) has an Invizimals PSP Bundle on their site for pre-order. This game comes with the PSP camera that will finally make is US debut. The PSP Go!Cam that was included in the Japan release was the PSP-450x. This upgraded camera will take pictures at a maximum resolution of 640&#215;480 and can capture video at 480&#215;270.

As of today there is no word for a PSPgo Camera. The usb camera that comes with Invizimals is not going to work with the PSPgo. Once again it seems that the PSPgo is getting left out in the cold.

BooyaGadget will keep you updated. We will be sure to give this camera a full test in the BooyaGadget lab. Invizimals releases on October 12, 2010

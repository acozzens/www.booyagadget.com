As a PS3 user we have waited long enough and now it seems that the wait is finally over.  The [Playstation Blog](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/10/14/netflixps3/) is reporting that a Netflix app will be popping up on the XMB next week.

The App has been redesigned, its faster, more effective and most importantly it can stream all the movies and television you love without having to find that little red disc.  Streaming disc-free begins on October 18th.

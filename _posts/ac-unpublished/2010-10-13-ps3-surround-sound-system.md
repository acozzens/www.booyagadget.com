Sony announced today at the Playstation Blog that they are releasing the PS3 Surround Sound System. This Sound System is a Soundbar that can enhance your current gaming experience.

There is no doubt that this Soundbar isn't going to replace your 7.1 DTS Sound System, but for those of us out there that are tight on space and budget, this device may fill that void.

The Sound System promises a rich, full sound. Two 10 watt speakers and a 30 watt built in subwoofer are responsible for delivering the sound. The speaker comes with one analog input and one optical input. The PS3 can plug straight into the speaker via the optical input.

For those of you looking for more information or a list of the specs. Head on over to the [Playstation](http://us.playstation.com/ps3/accessories/scph-98057.html) information page. It will set you back $179.99 and it ships next week.

If BooyaGadget gets their hands on this device we will be sure to give you a complete run down of the Sound System.

The UPC for this 98057Â PS3 Surround Sound System is 711719805700

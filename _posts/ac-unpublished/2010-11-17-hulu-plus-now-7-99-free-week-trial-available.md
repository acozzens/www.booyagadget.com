    Hulu Plus no 8 bucks a month Booya Gadget

This morning I awoke to an email from the Hulu Team. The rumors of a price drop in the Hulu Plus service are now reality. It is not quite the 5 bucks a month that was floating around the internet, but it is now $7.99. All current subscriptions have been lowered to the new price and each user will be credited $2 for each month that they have subscribed to Hulu Plus. You can now preview the service for free for a week and that has garnered old subscribers another $2 credit. Hulu is also offering up a referral program that can earn users up to 20 weeks free.

Here is the email.

_&#8220;Hi Booya Gadget,_

_Thanks for being a subscriber to Hulu Plus during our preview. We've been hard at work refining our existing applications, expanding the device coverage, and extending our content lineup. We're excited to announce that today, Hulu Plus is officially launching out of preview to anyone in the U.S. for just $7.99/month._

_Since we're now offering Hulu Plus at a lower price than during the preview, your subscription fee has been lowered to $7.99/month, and on your next billing cycle, we'll also automatically credit your account with $2 for each month you've been a subscriber. In addition, we're now offering a 1-week free trial for all new subscribers, so we'll be issuing you an additional $2 credit since the free trial wasn't in place during the preview._

_We'd also like to offer you the chance to earn more free time on Hulu Plus by helping us spread the word about the service. For each friend who uses your referral to join Hulu Plus, we'll give you two additional weeks for free, up to 20 weeks total. Each of your referrals will also receive two weeks free on their first month's subscription. For more details on the program and to invite your friends, please visit http://www.hulu.com/profile/referrals._

_Since the Hulu Plus preview began, we've added more TV shows and extended our device coverage. To see which shows are now available on Hulu Plus, please visit http://www.hulu.com/plus/content, and to see the most up-to-date list of supported TVs, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes, mobile phones, and tablets visit http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices._

_Thanks for supporting us during the Hulu Plus preview. We look forward to continuing to work on your behalf in the months and years to come._

_The Hulu Team&#8221;_

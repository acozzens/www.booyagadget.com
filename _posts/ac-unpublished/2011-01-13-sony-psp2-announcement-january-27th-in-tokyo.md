[\*Sony's Next Generation Portable Specs\*](http://wp.me/p18Y4L-HI)

Rumors are spreading that Sony is ready to announce the details of the much anticipated Playstation  Portable 2.  The rumored device has gotten plenty of press lately as the gaming community anxiously awaits it arrival.

We know very little about the device.  Rumors are that it will live separately along side it's Android powered counterpart, a High Definition Touch Screen, a possible track pad on the back of the device, two analog sticks, the ability to make phone calls over WiFi with programs like Skype.

No matter what the details, rumors that this little portable could be as powerful as the PS3 and the promise from Sony to integrate the entire Playstation line, excitement is warranted.  I love my PSP and I can't wait to get my hands on the next generation.  Stay tuned, we may just be days away.

\*UPDATE\*

Sony has confirmed that they will be holding a press conference tonight.  They were still reluctant to confirm any information regarding the PSP 2.  Since Booya Gadget is out on the West Coast this event starts at 10:00PM Pacific, 1:00AM Eastern.  Stay Tuned.

At Booya Gadget, we love the open-source Handbrake Video Converter/transcoding tool. Since we are very heavy at YouTube, we do a lot of video work to make our media available to our viewers in multiple formats. We have many uses for Handbrake at Booya Gadget, but my main use is converting to video podcast for our iTunes Podcast.  Booya TRJ uses Handbrake to <a title="TVersity Android How To" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2010/11/stream-movies-to-your-android-with-tversity.html" target="_blank">stream Movies to his Android and PSP using TVersity</a>.

I've worked with many paid and free video conversion tools, and Handbrake ( along with dvdfab ) is one of Booya's favorites&#8230; This Free tool is absolutely worthy of your time if it can fit your personal requirements.  If you fall in love, you may even consider a donation.  Looking at this list of updates, I assure many hours were spent by the contributing devs..

**Here are the Release Notes of 0.9.5 Handbrake.** Note that the devs make it clear that they want you to upgrade, and this upgrade is worth it.  Check out the features for yourself and try 'em out&#8230;

Best place to learn more about this release and the Handbrake Project in general&#8230; great info.

On March 28th Sony handheld gamers could be playing PSN games on their Android phone.  Sony Ericsson Xperia Play, the Playstation Phone should make its debut on the Verizon Wireless Network this spring and as the day gets closer I find myself drawn to the reality that I will probably get this phone.

As a bona-fide Sony fanboy, who works part time as Google fanboy it only seems logical that I own the alleged Playstation Phone.  In no way is this Android/PSP going to stop me from a day one purchase of the NGP, but it does intrigue me enough to dive in head first despite my hesitation after the PSPgo debacle.

The phone is releasing on the Verizon Network, and while most reports are not placing this Android as an exclusive, it's nice to know that Verizon will have this phone in their library.

The phone will ship with Android 2.3, Gingerbread.  This will give the phone an opportunity to deliver on some of the content Android is suppose to be providing.  Netflix, Hulu Plus, anyone, anyone.  On the slide out gaming pad it sports a dual analog touch pad, your common PS buttons and they all control a stunning 4&#8243; Touchscreen.

Rumors are swirling that all PSN content will have to be repurchased for the Xperia Play. First they made us repurchase our UMD games in digital form and now they are making us repurchase our digital form to another digital form.  I was always under the impression that the perk to switching from hard media to digital was to avoid situations like this, I stand corrected.

Still in debate about the Xperia Play.   Here are the specs.

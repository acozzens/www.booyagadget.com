With Sony's Next Generation Portable coming this holiday, the original PSP is getting a well deserved price drop.  According to the Playstation Blog the price cut will go into effect on Monday, February 27th making the  PSP-3000 available for $129.99.

The PSPgo avoids this round of price drops and will remain at $199.99.  Sony announced last month that they would be releasing a new Playstation Portable, code named [&#8220;Next Generation Portable&#8221; or NGP](http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/01/sonys-next-generation-portable-specs-psp-2.html).  Details of the 2011 holiday launch are still be worked out and a pricing structure has not been determined.

The PSP has sold nearly 66.2 million consoles worldwide since it first launched in Japan in December of 2004.  Sony is hoping that the NGP will make head way into the portable market that Nintendo has dominated.  The Nintendo DS has sold 145 million consoles and continues to dominate the portable market.

Sony is also taking their handheld gaming action into the smartphone arena.  Sony Ericsson will launch the [Xperia Play next month](http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/02/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-playstation-phone.html).  The Android based PSP Phone will be able to play PSP and PSone games from the yet-to-be released Playstation Suite.

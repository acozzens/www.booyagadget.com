Scentsy warmers began in 2003 and the process is simple.  Use the heat of a light bulb to melt the wax and spread the aroma.  Scentsy warmers and scents are only available through [sales consultants and their websites](https://lightheart.scentsy.us/Home) or onsite parties.

The warmers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with very intricate designs to meet the appeal of all customers, male or female.  The Warmer collections include variations of Art Deco, Campus, Cascade, Classic Imperial, Individual, Isabella, Island, Miracle, Patriot, Renaissance, and Sports.

The Warmers are also available in smaller plug-in style models great for small room and guest bathrooms.  The have all the style of the full-size warmer in a much smaller package.

The scents themselves come in many different flavors.  Far to many to list, but rest assured there is a scent for everyone and every occasion.  Whether you are looking for the mint and evergreen smells of Christmas to the beach and lilac scents of Summer.

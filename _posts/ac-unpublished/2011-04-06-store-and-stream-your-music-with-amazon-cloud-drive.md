  * **Upload music to your Cloud Drive**

Download the](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_uploader_install?nodeId=200593730#install) to upload your music into the cloud.  The uploader will search your hard drive for music or you can stop the process and manually direct the program to where your music is located.

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5595640703_75c0c0592d.jpg" alt="Amazon Cloud Player Booya Gadget" width="500" height="309" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/5595640703/ "Amazon Cloud Player Booya Gadget by BooyaGadget, on Flickr")

Once you have selected your music click &#8220;Start Upload&#8221; and all of your music will be sent into the cloud.  Instantly your music will arrive and you can start listening to it as soon as it uploads.  You have 5GB of free space so it will take some time to get it all uploaded.

  * **Amazon Cloud Player**

The Amazon Cloud Player plays within your browser and can sort music by song, album, artist, or genre.  You also have the ability to create playlist and to search for new music from the Amazon store.

<!--more-->All music uploaded will count towards your 5GB limit, but any music that you purchase from Amazon will be added to your library and will not count towards your space allotment.

Now the real asset to music in the cloud.  With the Amazon Cloud Player App for Android you can now take your music on the go.  Available through the Android Marketplace, the Amazon MP3 App will allow you to shop in the Amazon Music store and use the Amazon Cloud Player.  This is a MUST-TRY APPLICATION !  Your library anywhere.

The Amazon Cloud Player will play all of your music in the cloud and it can even play all of the music located on your Android device.  You can stream your Cloud music or you can download it to your device if you think you are headed into an area where 3G or WiFi may not be available.

**Considerations / Gotchas / Org Tips**

If you have 5 GB or under ( about 1,500 songs ) then this is going to be an extremely easy setup for you.  If you're like me and have 40+Gigs of music ( tens of thousands) then it can get tricky.  I was not satisfied with the interface for selecting only custom music.  So if you are very sloppy, setup could take a while.  But if you have 5 or less Gigs of music, this is a one touch setup.   Remember also that UPLOADING to the web, is much slower than downloading.  So don't be surprised if uploading your kick-ass library takes hours not minutes.  Set it and forget it.  If you just want to give it a test drive, then try a single song, or a single CD or album just to get a taste.

When you start getting a high volume of songs up there, I highly recommend you navigate, organize and edit playlists, remove songs etc using the WEB INTERFACE on your PC or laptop or you may snap.  The Droid app is best for pushing a button only, NOT for managing 1500 songs ! You heard it here first.  For god's sake, try this app there is not one reason not to.    I also strongly recommend that you setup playlists, both TRJ and Cuz are big genre sorters.  Because sometimes you don't want to listen to Brian McKnight when you're at the gym, and sometimes Alice in Chains just doesn't make for a romantic setting !

Overall this is an expected move for music and I expect a lot of copycat acts in the future, I hope so because I want more free storage.  Booya Gadget is all-in with the cloud in any way possible.  Will my laptop become obsolete ? ( no, but fun thought )  As a big believer in cloud storage and the ability to access that content anywhere I am a huge fan of this service.  Uploaded your music? Downloaded the app? Let us know what you think.  Do it, do it.

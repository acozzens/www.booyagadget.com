Wow, first my Windows Phone 7 got the nice update, and finally my (retired) myTouch 3g slide gets Love from HTC and T-Mobile.  Yes, Froyo is finally available for the amazingly patient slide owners.  I must have personally sent T-Mobile about 20 irate &#8220;Tweets&#8221; just to vent some frustration.  This is NOT an OTA Update, you need elbow grease, a USB cable, a visit to the HTC website and about 10-20 minutes.   I'll cover most of the install process here, and you can view our set on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/sets/72157626447071738/) if you want to see more of the pictures and guts of this operation.   Below are the features, tips, and here's a link to the &#8220;What's New Guide&#8221; PDF which is a good quick read.  Overall this took me about 10-15 minutes including brain farts.  Now I want to go fill up my 16GB SD Card, finally.

**GOTCHAS BEWARE**
  
If you do get the ERROR 170 Code like I did the first time in my haste of ignore instructions, it tells you to yank the battery, for a little hard reboot.  I didn't do that, I just power-cycled, and realized I totally ignored the HTC Sync software installation, as well as only enable sync from the usb connection screen.  If you didn't just skip the HTC sync install then check out these troubleshooting tips from HTC and verify that you are rocking the correct prerequisites for install.  I had to check, because I only use this phone for Words with Friends as an expensive alarm clock.  My phone was out of shape a little.<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5105/5597713480_daee4ca38e.jpg" alt="3 error warning install htc solved Froyo 2.2 Android MyTouch 3g" width="500" height="319" />

While you're at it, why don't you upload some [music to the Cloud with Amazon's streaming](/2011/04/store-and-stream-your-music-with-amazon-cloud-drive.html) service which ALL Booya Gadget staff members have already done. We are loving it and recommend it! Upload your music to the Cloud, and download the app from the marketplace. 5GB free, that's about 1500 songs, I highly recommend it! Enjoy your Froyo 2.2.1 update, I am far less angry now that I have what I want. ( spoiled consumer! )
  
Very Booya!

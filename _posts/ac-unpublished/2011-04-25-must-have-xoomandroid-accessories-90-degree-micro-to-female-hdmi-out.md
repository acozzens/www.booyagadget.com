This little guy was $8 well spent from Amazon.com.  It simply converts your [Micro HDMI out port to a female HDMI plug](https://alexa.design/2nXjdST).  The reason I like this was for the inexpensive cost, quick shipping, and the fact that it will help reduce potential damage to your tender <a title="Xoom HDMI demonstration" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/android-xoom-samsung-6500-tv-integration-hdmi-out-review.html" target="_blank">Micro HDMI port on your Xoom</a>, or any other Android or smart phone tablet device that has Micro HDMI Out.

One thing to remember, especially with the Xoom is that once you're in <a href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/android-xoom-samsung-6500-tv-integration-hdmi-out-review.html" target="_blank">HDMI Out mode</a>, it LOCKS your screen orientation. If you are trying to stand it up and use your Android Honeycomb Tablet, or similar device it <strong>will put a lot of pressure on your both your expensive HDMI cable and the actual female port itself on this device</strong>!  Even though this thing was designed for and by HTC for the EVO, it works great on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26field-keywords%3Dmotorola%2520xoom%2520wifi%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics&tag=booya-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Xoom Tablet by Motorola</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=booya-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />!

This [90 Degree Micro to Female HDMI converter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q64ZBE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004Q64ZBE) <img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B004Q64ZBE&camp=217145&creative=399349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />was $8 from Amazon, and I love having it around. Another benefit is that you don't have to purchase an additional Micro HDMI cable now, you just plug an HDMI cable in that you likely already own ! So it can save you money, and protect your equipment. You can rest it on the couch, desk, coffeetable etc safely because now it has a solid base and fits snugly. I was pumped to get it.  Think about it!

<strong>This sweet and Best Tablet Accessory</strong> can be used on any device that has a Micro HDMI port, so you don't have to have a Xoom, you just have to have a yuppy device that can pump your audio and video OUT to your TV!  I'm using it, and it might be a good fit for you as well. <strong>For the price, and its effectiveness, this gets an &#8220;A&#8221; rating.</strong> Even if you lost it or drove over it with a tank, you'd be out only $8, so that is a risk worth taking for the benefits that you gain .  This thing is very BOOYA indeed !

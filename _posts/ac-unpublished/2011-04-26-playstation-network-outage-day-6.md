As we approach a week without the PSN and Sony's Qriocity service we have no idea if the end is in sight.  An update, or lack thereof, was tweeted by Patrick Seybold and gave no real answers.  **80710092  An error has occurred. You have been signed out of Playstation Network**

**_&#8220;I know you are waiting for additional information on when PlayStation Network and Qriocity services will be online. Unfortunately, I don’t have an update or timeframe to share at this point in time._**

_As we previously noted, this is a time intensive process and we’re working to get them back online quickly. We’ll keep you updated with information as it becomes available. We once again thank you for your patience.&#8221;_

As gamers enter their 6th day without service I can only imagine that the natives are getting restless.  Today is Tuesday, which is usually reserved for PSN updates.  Countless Playstation users wait for word on whether this update will not only arrive, but signal the re-opening of the PSN.

Rumors are abound that an intrusion may have caused the shut-down and a leak that may have gave access to unlimited downloads of all of Sony's content.  Sony is possibly rebuilding the network from the ground up to increase security.  Sony has been mum on whether customer information was compromised in the alleged attack.  So 70 million worldwide subscribers sit and wait impatiently, while Sony attempts to regain control of their network.

**\*\*UPDATE\*\* April 26th (Day 6)**

A new post at the [Playstation Blog](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/26/update-on-playstation-network-and-qriocity/) has confirmed that an unauthorized intrusion did occur between April 17th and 19th to the Playstation Network.

_&#8220;Although we are still investigating the details of this incident, we believe that an unauthorized person has obtained the following information that you provided: name, address (city, state, zip), country, email address, birthdate, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online ID.&#8221;_

Once the PSN is restored Sony is advising that all users change their passwords immediately.  It is also noted that credit card information may have been obtained and the users should monitor their credit card statements for any unusual activity.

**\*\*UPDATE\*\* April 27th (Day 7)**

It appears that Sony is going to be taking its time in bringing the PSN back online.  According to the [Playstation Blog](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/26/clarifying-a-few-psn-points/) they hope to have &#8220;some&#8221; of the services back online within the week.

Hulu Plus is offering its customers a one week credit for the outage.  Apps like Netflix and Hulu are rendered useless without being signed into the PSN.  Hulu Plus subscribers should get and email with a link that will allow them to access their credit.

_&#8220;Unfortunately, due to the outage on PlayStation® Network, Hulu Plus subscribers cannot currently access the application on the PS3™. We understand this is frustrating, and we are looking forward to Sony restoring access to the application as soon as possible. In the meantime, we’d like to offer you a 1-week credit toward your Hulu Plus subscription.&#8221;_

**\*\*UPDATE\*\* April 28th (Day 8)**

There is a Q & A up on the [PS Blog today](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/27/qa-1-for-playstation-network-and-qriocity-services/). They are trying to answer some of the most common questions that have been thrown their way.  For the gamers out there wondering how long it will be before they can have an all-night gaming bender.  They are promising that &#8220;some&#8221; of the network will be up &#8220;one week from yesterday.&#8221;  Not sure what portions of the network are making the cut, but at least we have some sort of deadline.

Booya Gadget is one of the millions waiting, we will keep you posted as we find out more information on the outage.  To stay up to date on the PSN Outage follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/booyagadget) and Like us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/booyagadget).  In the meantime, you can check out the [Booya Gadget Store](http://www.booyagadget.com/free-ps3-themes), which is up and running.  No outage here and we've got all our PS3 Themes right here ready for download.

**Tonight, my Motorola Wifi Xoom, just got it's first OTA update HMJ37, so my Android Version now reads 3.1** I sat down after eating dinner, and smiled as I saw my update notification ! The update will touch on several different areas, but the most highly desired update SD CARD utilization is NOT included.  You can find this info around the block, but read on if you want to know my perspective, and I have an opinion on every feature. Booya !

    HMJ37 Xoom update now live on my Wifi Tablet
  </p>
</div>

**I have the WiFi Only Xoom so if you do too, you'll be in business soon** if you're not already.  Also noteworthy, is that **my Xoom is NOT rooted**, so the install was very fast and quite painless!   This is definitely NOT a waste of time of an update, there are some nice upgrades that will occur, but none that will make this device an iPad killer or anything like that.  Nonetheless, I love software / firmware updates especially when they mean more than just &#8220;fixed several bugs affecting only a few users&#8221;.

So here are the updates as indicated by Verizon  a while back ( prematurely ) and several other sources. **I threw in my own opinion on each feature**!  I see no reason why every Xoom in the Universe won't get these, just not sure yet if every proud owner ( like me ) will get them tomorrow.

Here is a short <a title="Update HMJ37 Short Install" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcpQ7y_Mr2c" target="_blank">Video of the notification, and kick off of the Quick Update for your Xoom:</a>
  
<span class="youtube"></span>

I didn't have to check my system, I simply had a popup notification.  If you want to know RIGHT NOW if you have the update, simply check:  Settings > About tablet > System updates It will tell you!   What's very interesting, is that AFTER the update, there is a new button on your system update screen so you can &#8220;CHECK NOW&#8221;  !

**Web Browsing and Data Access** 

  * Access and stay connected to Wi-Fi networks with added Proxy support. **( May be nice for Wifi Proxy Users )**
  * SSL data transfer with websites is now supported.  **( Nice for some users, if you use, or want to use SSL transfer a lot )**
  * WPA Pre-Shared Key pass-phrases are now supported when using the device as a Mobile Hotspot.  **( Nice for Hot Spotters )**
  * Supports Google Widevine DRM and HDCP. **( <a href="http://www.widevine.com/" target="_blank">Widevine is media DRM company</a>, which Google purchased, kind of opens the door for streaming media options in the future :) )**

**Email and Messaging POP3**

  * HTML emails will display in their entirety. **( Guess I haven't had this issue, or it hasn't bothered me )**

**Call Features**

  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bluetooth® is now supported in Google Talk</span>™. **( I love for EVERY app to be able to use BlueTooth, very nice for Talk Users, so you're chat buddy can be heard on your stereo or PC speakers! )**

**Additional Device Features** 

  * Encrypted passwords can be entered during power up. **( I just haven't had to do this )**
  * Calendar events will remain up to date after an installed software update. **( thanks )**
  * Application storage errors will not appear unless the device has reached maximum storage capacity.  **( Not my problem yet )**
  * Safely dock the MOTOROLA XOOM into the docking adapter without interruption. **( No good docking adapters yet )**
  * Ability to add and use a Bluetooth mouse. **( Very Nice, but not used widely yet, and BT mice kind of spendy, keyboards too )**
  * A shortcut key for the Bluetooth keyboard has been added.  **( see above )**
  * View and import pictures from digital cameras with <a title="Picture Transfer Protocol Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">Picture Transfer Protocol</a>. **( I don't transfer photo to my Xoom, do you ? )**
  * When using the device in accessibility mode, menus will no longer prompt with sounds. **( I don't use accessibility mode, this is for those with disabilities, but users of this mode may appreciate the tweak )**

&nbsp;

So as you can see there are some very nice updates actually, I just don't think the MAJORITY of users will benefit from every feature.  **Most every BooyaGadget.com reader I speak with wants SD Card useage**, which makes a lot of sense !

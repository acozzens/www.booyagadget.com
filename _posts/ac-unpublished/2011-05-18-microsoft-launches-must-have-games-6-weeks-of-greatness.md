    Awesome New Games for WP7
  </p>
</div>

I was totally pumped up today to see a new page at XBox.com.    Microsoft has now launched a badass new campaign, 6 consecutive weeks of new <a title="Link to Microsoft Must Have Games Page ! AWESOME" href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Mobile/MustHaveGames/home" target="_blank">MUST HAVE games for your Windows Phone 7</a>. You should be smiling right now, because the lineup is GREAT !  I have a LOT of devices ( too many ? )  and these are fantastic games, many of which will be familiar to past or current Android, iPhone and Tablet owners!   The bad news, is that this lineup SMOKES our existing &#8220;<a title="best games for wp7" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/03/top-7-best-windows-phone-7-games.html" target="_blank">Best Games for WP7</a>&#8221; article, but it will be well worth it, **because this is a Star Studded lineup**.

**Microsoft sums this entire article up VERY well with their marketing message, which I really like:**

_No matter what kind of games you enjoy, the lineup of Must Have Games has something for you, delivering the biggest names in mobile games complete with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Xbox LIVE Achievements</span>, leaderboards, and more_**.**

**

Shutting up, I will now move on to the actual games.. All this magic starts Wednesday May 25th, so get ready to spend some money on some great titles, that I personally title as &#8220;Booya Certified WP7 Games!&#8221;

YES !  Here is the list, I am pumped to pass on this news, and I cannot wait to drop a little cash.  Games like this will help propel this great Mobile Phone operating system.  **The more games, apps, and users we have the better.  I will also say, months later, I STILL LOVE MY WP7 !**

And let me just remind you one last time, **these games yield XBox Live Achievements**.  Honestly, I LOVE this, and if you're a fellow XBox console owner you should too.  If you don't have an XBox, it is time&#8230;

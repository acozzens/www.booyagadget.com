[The Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore?hl=en-US) is alive and well and they are giving away everyone's favorite game, [Angry Birds](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aknpkdffaafgjchaibgeefbgmgeghloj?hl=en-US).  In addition to this freebie they have added the &#8220;Chrome Dimension,&#8221; which adds 7 more levels specifically designed for your Chrome Browser App.  The keys to these new levels are hidden withing the current Angry Bird levels.

The [Angry Bird Chrome Web App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aknpkdffaafgjchaibgeefbgmgeghloj?hl=en-US) plays right inside your Google Chrome Browser and felt just like any of Angry Bird versions I have ever played.  The game autosaves your progress within your browser so the next time you log-in you can pick up right where you left off and since you are playing in the cloud you can play your game from whatever PC you can find.

**Gameplay**

Everything is done with the mouse.  The wheel will zoom you in and out, while moving the mouse up, down, left, and right will navigate you around the screen.  Simply press and hold the left mouse button over the bird in the slingshot, move the mouse to select your speed and trajectory.  Once you are happy with your set-up, let go.  For Birds that require mid-flight moves, click the left mouse button to activate those specials.

**Chrome Dimension**

Rovio has added 7 new levels to Angry Birds, but the twist is you have to find them first. The first hidden Chrome Icon doesn't appear until Level 1-16.  Located high above the action in the far right corner of the screen is a ledge with a chrome icon.  Fire one of your Birds, hit the icon and unlock the first of seven Chrome Dimension Levels.

If you're struggling with the all new <a title="Angry Birds Chrome Dimensions 4-1, 4-2, 4-3 SPOILERS!" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/05/angry-birds-chrome-dimensions-4-1-4-2-4-3-spoilers.html" target="_blank">Angry Birds Chrome levels:  here is our walkthru for 3 Stars on 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3 to help you out !</a>

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2646/5740265167_627567b8cb.jpg" alt="Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (5)" width="375" height="280" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/5740265167/ "Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (5) by BooyaGadget, on Flickr")

You will need to use the mouse wheel to zoom all the way out.  Then launch your Bird towards the ledge.  I am going to lie to you and tell you that I hit it on my first try. Either way at some point you will make a direct hit and you will be rewarded with this.

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3650/5740817764_0728dbbe41.jpg" alt="Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (6)" width="375" height="280" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/5740817764/ "Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (6) by BooyaGadget, on Flickr")

You do not have to complete the level, you can exit the game and go right into Chrome Dimension.  You will notice that a level is now available for selection.  The new level that you have just opened will look just like this.

[<img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5740818312_ab21c8ff8a.jpg" alt="Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (7)" width="375" height="280" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/5740818312/ "Free Chrome Web App - Angry Birds Chrome Dimension (7) by BooyaGadget, on Flickr")

So there you have it.  One more spin on the viral game that is Angry Birds.  This version is well worth it since the price is FREE and it plays right in your browser.  This will only work for all you Google Chrome Minions out there, since Google Chrome Web Apps are only currently compatible with the Chrome Browser.  This really isn't a problem for all the guys and girls out there like me that have already sworn their life to all things Google.  So what are you waiting for, go pick it up.  Plus there are load of other free games and apps in the Chrome Web Store just waited to be played with.  You might even find [BooayGadget](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loanlkbppobcmbmbjokodkgpfamgddom?hl=en-US) in there.  Booya!

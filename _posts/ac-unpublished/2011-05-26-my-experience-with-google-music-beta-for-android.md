**What Is this &#8220;Google Music Beta&#8221; ?**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Google Music is simply a new tool that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">UPLOAD YOUR MUSIC</span> files to the magical cloud in the sky, and have access to it anytime, anywhere you have internet access either on your Android device, or a web browser..  Let me be explicit, you have to have the song on your PC to send it up, so if you don't have a nice digital mp3 collection then this may not be sexy to you yet.  If you don't have a digital MP3 library, I highly recommend you catch up to 2011, damn near everything I own is digital now.  I HATE having discs laying around, movies or CD's..

I tend to always throw my hat in the ring for Google Beta products, the last time it was for our <a title="All you want to know about Google Voice" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2010/12/google-voice-review-impressions-and-5-transcribe-samples.html" target="_blank">Google Voice review</a>, this time it was <a title="Get your Own invite" href="http://music.google.com/about/" target="_blank">Google Music Beta</a> where you can request your own invite if you're impatient for a formal release.  We've already written about <a title="Our Review and Links to Free 5Gb Amazon Cloud MP3" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/store-and-stream-your-music-with-amazon-cloud-drive.html" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud MP3</a>, and to me these are very similar services.  Hold a gun to my head, and **I'll choose Google over Amazon Mp3 but in the end they're all really similar.**

&nbsp;

Most important right off the bat, is **that Google Music allows a 20,000 song upload limit.** If you have more than that, then you are friggin LOCO !  That is a crapload of music.  I'm a tech-nerd, and have about 5,300 songs including audio books.  That is plenty of music and will literally fill DAYS of music play so if you have more than that, you must be in some kind of 90th percentile.  I also question your ability to manage over 5,000 songs.. anyways..

**UPLOADING with MUSIC MANAGER**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Depending on how much music you have it *may* take a crapload of time.</strong> Just in case you don't know, uploading on the internet is WAY slower than downloading so don't expect the same experience as you do with normal web surfing.  I literally set up my Google Music Manager, and went to bed.  If you have hundreds of songs only, then this shouldn't be too bad of an experience, but if you're in the thousands, then just be patient.  However, a very nice user experience is that you can indeed use Google Music Beta WHILE your music is uploading.  So you can basically test right away.  If you happen to be a little more hardcore, all my iTunes library is stored on my FreeNAS server and this worked just the same.

</div>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Basically, you point the music manager to a folder of your choice.  Just like Amazon MP3 Cloud,  this can be a bit sketchy.  If you have a LOT of music, like over 2,000 songs at least, then you may want to just create a test folder.  If you have under 1,000 songs then just plug this sucker in and you may have an easier experience than I did uploading a big-ass library of music.
</p>

**FREEBIES**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In fact, when you sign up, Google let's you pick a handful of songs by Genre.  A nice touch, especially if you have no music ready for upload.  Just another way to try out there services yourself.. For me, I selected what I normally would by genre, but this is not the selling factor of this service, just a nice touch.  Maybe you get lucky and one of their freebies is right in your wheelhouse.  For me, all it did was screw up my collection by adding genre's I don't use.  I would never complain getting free stuff, but for example, I had to go change their free music genre from &#8220;RAP / HIP HOP&#8221; to &#8220;RAP&#8221; because it added an extra genre on my screen.  Picky, but I run a tight musical ship.

**DEVICES / SOFTWARE**

I certainly don't have every Android O.S. device, but I do have a myTouch 3g Slide and Motorola Xoom.  Within seconds of signing up and getting setup online, my Google Music player on my WiFi <a title="All our Articles on the Motorola Xoom" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/category/xoom-tablets" target="_blank">Xoom </a>definitely knew that I was in the Music Beta, as did my Slide.  In fact, I've been hammering BOTH devices with G Music the past several days.  As a &#8220;can I break it test&#8221;, I was able to play music simultaneously on my Slide, Xoom, and even the Web Player.  A fun, corny test, but interesting nonetheless.  This means your wife could stream via the phone at a friends house, and you could use the Browser to stream at home during poker night and both enjoy a shared library&#8230;  A stretch, but a successful test nonetheless.

A nice feature, ( expected ), is the desktop widget provided with Google Music.   Nothing fancy, especially on the myTouch, but you can very easily place a GMB music on your desktop and drive your tunes. I did it all the time in my test drive.

**THE GOOD AND THE BAD**.

I had a little notepad file that I used to gather my tangible impressions over the past few days.. Here are the results!

**THE BAD**

  * 1,000 song limit for playlists ( Very annoying when I have a genre with 1,200 songs, WTF should I do ? Manally do it ? )
  * Cannot rate thumbs up / down from Droid Player ( I REALLY HATE THIS )
  * Long time to upload, but worth it
  * Fine Tuning must happen on website
  * Locked the Hell out of my Xoom a couple times
  * Choppy when multi tasking on several occasions
  * Tough to stop an upload if your music is not organized well

**THE GOOD**

  * 20,000 song limit ( that is a LOT of music )
  * One Click Create a playlist based on a song
  * Easy to edit song information ( like changing genre,or album info manually ) online, for fine tuning ( easier than Amazon Mp3 )
  * Easily store desired songs for trips etc..  Stores your most recent library if you don't have internet connection
  * Bluetooth to home stereo and car works great
  * Auto Playlists based on songs that you give a &#8220;THUMBS UP&#8221; to ( BUT, you can't thumbs up on the device )
  * Album Covers look nice
  * Pleasant viewing Landscape or Portrait mode on your device
  * Multiple devices, worked same on myTouch 3g Slide and Android Xoom
  * Nice little Widgets for your Droid Home Screen / Desktop

**SUMMARY / OVERALL**

This is a cool service supported by Google muscle.  I read a lot of other reviews where people had bad experiences, I had a predictable experience, and this was no emergency although I was eager to spend some time and share an article with you.  I was expecting just what I got, because we had already done a deep dive on <a title="Amazon mp3 Cloud 5Gb free Music Storage in the Cloud" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/store-and-stream-your-music-with-amazon-cloud-drive.html" target="_blank">Amazon MP3 Cloud</a>.  It had a VERY similar feel to it.  **Google Music is NOT a must have for non music lovers**, or if you just have very little music.  For me, and most of <a title="About Booya Gadget" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/about" target="_blank">BooyaGadget.com</a> it's a must have.   I care very little about any &#8220;privacy&#8221; concerns.  If Al Qaeda hacked my account, what are they going to do ? Listen to my Wiz Khalifa songs? Go ahead..  It's just a convenient service that I will personally use, but if you find yourself wondering if you're missing out, then you're probably not.  Stick with <a title="Pandora is Badass on Android Download Now" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.pandora.android&feature=search_result" target="_blank">Pandora </a>and <a title="Jango is Pandora's Little Brother on Android Download Now" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jangomobile.android&feature=search_result" target="_blank">Jango </a>which are really good alternatives to this kind of service.  There are a handful of improvements to be made, and to me this is simply a backup service and alternative listening source for my music.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ? BOOYA !

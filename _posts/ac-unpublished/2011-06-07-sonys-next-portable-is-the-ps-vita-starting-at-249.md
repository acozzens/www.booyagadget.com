Sony announced that the formerly known NGP would become the [PlayStation Vita &#8211; WiFi](http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Vita-WiFi-Sony-PSP/dp/B003O6EATE%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIWVRLGBW3T7JNEGA%26tag%3Dbooya-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003O6EATE) and will be available to gamers starting at $249 for the WiFi only version.  AT & T will carry a 3G model that will be available for $299 and should be in our hands by the end of the year. Over 80 developers are rumored to be working on Vita titles and Sony is promising a very strong line-up by the launch date.  Some of the games expected to be launched on the new handheld were shared at the E3 Press Conference.

This is exciting news for the handheld community and I have to admit I am very excited for this product to hit the shelves.  With the rapidly growing tablet market and everyone carrying smartphones the true gamer in me was worried about the health of  hard core handheld gaming.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some Angry Birds, but truth be told deeper titles like Kingdom Hearts are where my true gaming love resides.  Keeping the true portable gaming model alive means that the heavy hitter developers can keep bringing us expansive story-driven titles like the Uncharted Series.

The ability to cross-platform titles with my PS3 has always been a high priority for me as a handheld and console gamer.  I have always wanted my portable Sony console to be an extension of my home console.  Sony announced that the PS Vita will be able to cross-platform with some PS3 titles.  [Wipeout](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/06/02/wipeout-your-ps3-opponents-on-ngp/) will be one of those titles that supports this feature.  Be sure to grab up your Free Copy of Wipeout HD Fury for your PS3 from the Welcome Back Program if you haven't already bought this high speed racer.

The handheld also supports &#8220;party chat,&#8221; which will enable gamers to chat with their Playstation friends across the network, regardless of which game they each are playing.

After the dust settled the news that brought joy to my heart was the price structure.  With $600 tablets becoming the norm and the fiasco of the price point of the PS3, I feared that Sony would cripple their latest handheld with a high price.  However, they delivered in my opinion with an affordable price and two very nice options.

WiFi only at $249 is a good price and a great option for a gamer like myself.  I am not going to change my carrier to get a PS Vita and I actually have no interest in a 3G gaming only handheld.  Keeping the price under 300 bucks makes this a day one purchase for me and keeps me excited for this release later this year.

You can pre-order today at Amazon &#8211; [PlayStation Vita &#8211; WiFi](http://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Vita-WiFi-Sony-PSP/dp/B003O6EATE%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIWVRLGBW3T7JNEGA%26tag%3Dbooya-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB003O6EATE)

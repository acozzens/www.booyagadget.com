Xoom owners are rejoicing with the latest update that provides the highly desireable Micro SD Card support.  Yes, even on my own 32 GB Wifi Model Xoom, I got the notification and easily installed update HTJ85B.   I can confirm right now that SD Card support works great and adds a massive amount of flexibility to my tablet options. Since I received the update in the evening, I had to wait a day before heading off to pickup my [32 GB Micro SD Card](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26field-keywords%3Dmicro%2520sd%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&tag=booya-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=booya-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />

**Update HTJ85B also includes an interesting &#8220;Zoom&#8221; feature** to help enjoy mobile applications that were not intended for tablets. Once installed, you will receive a pop-up message on your screen describing how to use the new zoom feature. In general, it appears at the bottom-right of your screen in the task bar and gives you a couple options if you stumble on an application that looks like crap. I think it's a nice touch, but nowhere near as valuable as SD Card support.

  Many Xoom owners have been patiently awaiting this update including myself.   I have a 32 GB model Wifi-Only Xoom, and although I still have plenty of GB Storage left, I have been holding off totally loading it with media.  Since I use both <a title="My Experience with Google Music Beta for Android" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/05/my-experience-with-google-music-beta-for-android.html" target="_blank">Google Music</a>, and <a title="Best Android Apps: Amazon Cloud Player 5GB of your Music Anywhere" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/store-and-stream-your-music-with-amazon-cloud-drive.html" target="_blank">Amazon Cloud MP3</a>, I previously I loaded only about  500 of my favorite mp3-songs.. But now my entire 18GB iTunes library is being moved, as well as a<a title="Easy Tutorial: Optimize Movies for Xoom with Handbrake" href="http://www.booyagadget.com/2011/04/easy-tutorial-optimize-movies-for-xoom-with-handbrake.html" target="_blank"> crapload of 700MB &#8211; 1GB awesome movies</a>.   The only other consideration will be to add large rom files for Nintendo 64 and Playstation emulator apps that previously got de-prioritized.  Now I can fit more than Final Fantasy on my tablet!

  <strong>HOW TO ADD THE SD CARD TO YOUR XOOM</strong>
</p>

  * The Micro SD Card slot is located on top of your Motorola Xoom, I simply used my fingernail to easily to pry open the SD Card slot .
  * Once you remove the storage casing, push down on the small Micro SD protective fake.  This will pop it up, remove the sucker.
  * Now put your shiny new 4,8,16,32, or 64 GB Micro SD card in.  Easy as that!
  * Re install the casing, go to your system settings, and marvel at all the new storage you have.
  * Load the storage with a butt-load of media files and enjoy the hell out of your Xoom Tablet running Honeycomb 3.2

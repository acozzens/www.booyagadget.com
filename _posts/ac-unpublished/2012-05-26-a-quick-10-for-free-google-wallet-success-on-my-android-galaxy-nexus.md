**&#8220;Make your phone your wallet&#8221;**
  
The <a title="Google Wallet App Link on Play Store" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Wallet mobile app</a> allows you to pay online and in brick-and-mortar stores that accept Google Wallet, you can pay by tapping your phone at the point of sale.  Currently it comes pre-loaded on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  You can pay with <a title="Google Wallet Official Link" href="http://wallet.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Wallet</a> anywhere MasterCard PayPass is accepted

I recently picked up the Samsung Galaxy Nexus from Google Play to compare with my other Android the <a title="TMobile Galaxy s2 Android Samsung" href="http://galaxy-s.t-mobile.com/samsung-galaxy-s2" target="_blank">TMobile Galaxy S2</a>. **One feature I had to try is the much hyped Google Wallet**, which utilizes <a title="NFC Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication" target="_blank">NFC ( near field communication) technology</a>.  ( a secure chip in your phone )  Would I continually use Google Wallet ? Yes, but I do see it as a competitor to my beloved PayPal.  Regardless, the concept of paying with my phone is cool.  As a light germaphobe, I hope that at some point, many years in the future,  <a title="Mythbusters Germs Money Video recap" href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-fever-pitch-aftershow.html" target="_blank">dirty filthy currency</a> will become far less used.  I'd also like to be able to commonly bump my phone to exchange info or  pay a friend for lunch or stuff like that, but it will be a long time if ever, <a title="NFC vs Google Wallet vs PayPal CNet" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57441842-94/is-nfc-killing-google-wallet/" target="_blank">as we need widespread adoption and other methods may arise</a>.

**Setup was easy enough on the Wallet App using my Gmail account**, and once complete I indeed had the $10 free pre-loaded on my Google Card &#8220;PayPass&#8221; card.  Interestingly, the web browser version is completely different than the app stores on my phone, this is kind of lame, but I assume it will be &#8220;fixed&#8221; in the future.  At my local gas station, I've forever seen that PayPass terminal but I've never been able to use it.  But with my new Galaxy Nexus, I bumped and paid courtesy of Google's free $10 for trying the service.  Booya !

**The cashier had zero issues**, he was ready for me to &#8220;pay with credit&#8221; by bumping my phone on the PayPass terminal.  I was scared I was going to have to explain like I did with my <a title="Vudu / Walmart Disc 2 Digial Pics" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/103634451947822848111/albums/5736178805310726273" target="_blank">Vudu/Walmart Disc2Digital debacle</a>.  But no, it made little difference to the cashier whether I was swiping cards or bumping phones.  This was refreshing.  Curious of my &#8220;bleeding edge tech adoption&#8221; **I asked if I was the first to use the system, and sadly, I was NOT.**  I was his second ever customer try pay with the Phone Bump NFC Google Wallet Method :(  Although my nerd-pride was hurt, I was happy to have such a successful test on Google's dime.

**BASIC HOW TO PAY WITH GOOGLE WALLET STEPS**

  * Just setup the Wallet App on your phone
  *  Go to the store with a PayPass terminal, tell them &#8220;Pay with Credit&#8221;
  * Unlock your phone and press the back against the terminal.  ( i'm unlocking with my Face and Pin :) )
  * Enter your PIN if requested ( you may have to bump the device again )
  * If successful, you'll get a new screen indicating successful payment and your teller will hand you a receipt to sign(since it's credit).
  * If Not, the App will ask you to press your device to the terminal again. No sweat, I had to the first time. ( rookie lol )

**Saving Money With Wallet!**  A Bonus add-on to Google Wallet is that it offers discounts/coupons and offers to legit retail stores when you pay with your phone.  Just click on &#8220;OFFERS&#8221; in your App and see some nice discounts, stuff like 10%-15%  off etc..

**If you're curious about availability, there is a great add-on app** ( which I think should be built into wallet ) that finds PayPass terminals near your location.  It worked great, and I recommend you download this free app now ( if curious ), or after you get your Nexus or NFC enabled phone.  Here is the link to the <a title="MasterCard PayPass Locator Free App Play Store" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mastercard.paypass" target="_blank">PayPass Locator, on the Play Store</a>.

**SUMMARY&#8230; &#8220;A SMOOTH, HIGH-TECH TRANSACTION&#8221;**

I don't know if Wallet / NFC tech will thrive or if it's dead already, but I thought it was pretty cool and a good experience.  As I continue to use Google Wallet, I will just pre-load money onto the default card.  If you have an NFC / Google Wallet enabled phone, I'd say go spend $10 on Google.  Now-a-days a phone is as commonly carried as a wallet / purse, it might as well serve as a payment method as well.  I like Google Wallet and services like this, I hope they succeed, I'll test them out :)

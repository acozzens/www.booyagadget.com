I love my Asus Transformer Prime, and the <a title="Transformer Prime Keyboard Dock Amazon Purchase Link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00685ZDB2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00685ZDB2" target="_blank">keyboard docking station</a> (~$116). A good case is a must for me as well, so I was very happy to get, and highly recommend, the <a title="Poetic Case on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072XQI2W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0072XQI2W" target="_blank">Poetic(TM) ASUS Transformer Prime TF201 Leather Keyboard Portfolio Stand Case Cover for TF201 (AMAZON PURCHASE LINK)</a>.

While it has 1 or 2 drawbacks, it's one of the best cases I've ever reviewed, for my needs this case was perfect and the price is all the way down to [$17.95 on Amazon]((http://amzn.to/2sReTs3){:target="_blank"} at the time of this article. This soft "leather'ish" case can be separated for "tablet-only" useage, but it's best when used in tandem with the eee Pad docked to the keyboard.

By the way, the Mobile Keyboad Docking station sure is nice to have and it changes the way I use my tablet!  It's a must have if it fits your budget.

##### THE GOOD

* Price for this [android case was pretty good](http://amzn.to/2sReTs3){:target="_blank"} started at $17.95 at the time.
* Nice soft feel. Not sure if it's "real leather", but it sure feels nice
* Provide padding and protection for your tablet and dock
* Holes are in the right places, so you can access both cameras,flashes, and data/power ports respectively
* Easy, Simple, and Fast setup and removal when necessary
* If separated from the Keyboard Dock, the tablet only portion of the case doubles as a stand.

##### THE BAD

  * When closed up, this case adds significant bulk and thickness..
  * The Mobile Keyboard Dock accessory is nice to have, but an expensive add-on ( $116 )

I burn through apps more than most, because I like to write about them for our readers, so it was getting a bit crazy.  I'm also a total feature snob!  I had to search around myself for a way to organize, sort, and clear out some space on my Motorola Xoom featuring the Honeycomb Android operating system.  **I found a must have app and it is the Folder Organizer** by [Fabio Collini](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Fabio+Collini){:target="_blank"}. Looks like it averages 4.5 Stars, so although you should, you don't have to take my word for it..  About 9k users nice enough to review the app agree with me.

The app is <strong>NOT FREE, but about $1.50 USD</strong> and worth all the pennies to keep yourself from going berserk with all your games, apps, shortcuts, contacts, and bookmarks.  The key to this app is what I call "garbage in-garbage out".  I run a tight ship, and this must-have application requires your assistance.  If you don't customize it then you don't get a well oiled ship.  It is worth some time and the earlier you do it the better, create your own system.

If you're wondering, YES it does have widgets, and a lot of them which are very customizable that's what you get for a paid app.  This might be the best but I didn't try every single one.

It has a powerful organization engine for contacts and bookmarks, but for me I used it mainly for the labeling system which I recommend for you as well.  The general principle is that every app gets a label.  You can use the built-in labels, and create your own and I did both.  In particular, I found the volume of my games a bit much, so I simply used the app's built in "Games" label and then added my own sub-categories as well such as: Puzzles, Action,Shooters, Card Games and so on.  At the time of this article I didn't see this app in the Amazon App store, so just cruise to the Droid Store.

It reminds me of my iTunes collection.. Sometimes you don't want to listen to hard core rap and sometimes you just want to play a simple game.. <strong>But where the hell is the app ??  Problem solved with Folder Organizer</strong>.  This, or a similar app is a must have, but I highly recommend that before you purchase you consider all the features.  I recommend this app very strongly but if you're not willing to work at it it's kinda useless although it will give you some love just with the default settings.

Another badass feature is even MORE <strong>customization of appearance by using your own custom icons.</strong> With Folder Organizer, if you give it a little love and elbow grease, you will reap great rewards!  If you kiss this app on the mouth, it kisses back guaranteed it happened to me.

One thing I like to keep track of is busted apps, force closers, or non-honeycomb optimized games etc.  Right after the error or nasty undesireable gameplay, I slap a label on it:  ***BUSTED BROKEN SUCKS** or similar, and then<strong> they're automatically added to that magic folder</strong> so I can follow up with an email to the dev or a rating in the market to help the next guy.   Check out a bunch more photos HERE that I did not include in this article to see a little of my strategy.  In general, I can't tell you how to use this but I can give you some tips.  We all organize and think differently so I'd just encourage you to play around and customize this app for how YOU need it done!!  This is a must have app for folks that LOVE APPS ( me included ).. BOOYA !

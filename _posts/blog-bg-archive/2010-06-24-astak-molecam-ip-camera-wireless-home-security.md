excerpt: "Home security cams are fun, they can get a bit tricky to use, but it's worth it. I have 2 models 1 is the dlink dcs920, and the other is what I will show here, the Astak MoleCam. It's pretty slick, pan n tilt, remote view via Yoics, motion detection. I'll show you the daytime and night time functionality that I use."

Nightime Video of BooyaGadget producer CuzLuv being caught by MoleCam.. Would this be a valuable video to show the police ? I think so. It records audio too, and I have heard myself snoring, WOW.

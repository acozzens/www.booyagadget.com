The video below shows a common setup I use at home. Over-the-air HD TV on the laptop, Playstation 3 on TV. It simply depends on what I have going on..

The main catch using 950q HD Antenna is that I found it works best in big cities, and it does provide somewhat limited selection. But the price is FREE after purchasing the 950q.
For example, I've had best results in Portland and Seattle. Bad results in Wyoming and Oahu in Hawaii.

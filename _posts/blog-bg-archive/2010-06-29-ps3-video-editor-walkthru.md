First step is to make sure that you have some personal video loaded onto your PS3 Hard Drive. You are not allowed to use copyrighted material.
  Launch the Video Editor tool from the XMB by clicking on "Create a New Video"
  
The editor is a 3 step process.

#### Step #1 is to add your video.

Click on the Add Button.This will launch your Videos folder on the PS3. Select the videos you would like to upload to Youtube/Facebook. Repeat this process if you are going to make a highlight reel. Once you are done click on continue in the lower right hand corner.

#### Step 2 is to Edit your video.

In my example I did not dive into editing video. I did add music to my highlight reel. You do this by clicking on the music button to the right of your video. There you can select from a set number of tracks that Sony has provided.You can click on your video in the middle of the screen to preview your video and audio. When you are satisfied click on the continue button.

#### Step #3. Upload your Video or Save your Video to your PS3 Hardrive.

Now that you have created your video you can upload it to Youtube/Facebook or you can save it to your harddrive. If you chose to upload your video to the internet you will have to have a Youtube or Facebook account. Â  If you do not have an account then you must go to a PC and set one up.
  
Once your video is uploaded you can watch it on your Youtube channel on your PS3 or from your PC.

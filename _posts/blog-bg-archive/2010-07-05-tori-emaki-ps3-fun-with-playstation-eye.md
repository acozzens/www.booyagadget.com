I picked up the Eye in anticipation of the [PS3 Move](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J51U?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002I0J51U).
  
Tori-Emaki is fun but probably best used as a conversation starting interactive screen saver at your house with people over. &#8220;Walk by my PS3 and wiggle yer fingers&#8221;

I think [PlayStation Eye](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VTQ3LU?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000VTQ3LU) activity will pick up a lot when the [Move](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J51U?ie=UTF8&tag=booya-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002I0J51U) comes out since there will be ways to combine both technologies. Honestly, the PS3 Eye is actually an impressive tool..

If you want a real game using the eye, I'd recommend Trials of Topoq, which is kind of a &#8220;full body marble madness&#8221;&#8230;

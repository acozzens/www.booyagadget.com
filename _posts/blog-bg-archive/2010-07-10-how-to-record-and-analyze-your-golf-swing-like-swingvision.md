Assuming you're a golf lover, like everyone else we strive to improve our games. I have worked with golf coaches, and my favorite coaches have always used video. If you haven't I highly working with a coach that uses video, or as I show in this video, you can always record your own swing.

There is no better training that to actually see yourself swing, and if you own an expensive HD or even non-HD camera you should absolutely record your own swing. It does not take long, and you can do it in your backyard. Compare your swing to the professionals and thank us later.  

If you are looking more for an Android or iPhone golf swing analyzer, I do recommend [V1 Golf](http://www.v1sports.com/athletes-consumers/v1-golf-app/).  It's actually the same app my swing coach used when I was getting lessons. I took my iPad to a driving range, and used the V1 Golf app to show him his own swing. What a difference it made. Soon after our visit to the range, he had an amazing round shooting a legit 72.

However, even if you are not a golfer you can use the High Speed Recording feature of any camera to capture slow-mo action. Could be other sports, like football,baseball or basketball. Even parents can use it to make a cool video of their children, just depends on the stuff you do. Bottom line, test the feature out, you don't need the fancy-dancy video editing programs like [Sony Vegas](http://amzn.to/2dYHlQk) and Adobe to do this. 

We both agree, it's time to put yourself on SportsCenter FINALLY !

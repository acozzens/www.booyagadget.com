If you watch a lot of sporting events or other TV here is how you can build a setup using the [Hauppauge 950Q](http://amzn.to/2eQ75Qz) to watch the games on up to 3 TV screens, outside, or even on the road from your vehicle ! Best part is that I turned my cable off months ago, all i'm using are HighDef antennas and I'm getting the largest sporting events available on basic channels like ABC,NBC, and CBS. I LOVE IT !

How much do you pay for cable ? I pay ZERO DOLLARS PER MONTH !  I just use this little Antenna and it gives me the basic stations in High Def.   In the video demonstration, I show you how I use the Hauppauge 950q in 3 cool ways.

**First**, I use it to cast the World Cup game on 3 different screens in my living room.

**Secondly**, I take it outside.  Watching TV outside is sweet, and it's a sweet Tech-Showoff for your next Sporting Event gathering !

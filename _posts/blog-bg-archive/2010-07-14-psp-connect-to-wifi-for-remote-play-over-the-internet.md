Finally got connected over the internet from my [PSP 3000](http://amzn.to/2ftUoOX). Took some time to work after a few hours of tinkering with network setup. It is a slick little feature, and is worth the time involved to get your setup working.

1 key tip is testing this in your house, but connecting via INTERNET. This never worked until I made the necessary changes. This is a huge benefit, because it saves time instead of driving around to hot spots. If connecting to Remote Play works in your house via internet, it worked outside for me too! I knew once I got it to work, that it would work at McD's !

I have the [D-Link DIR-655](http://amzn.to/2f3LAL6), and this required changes to both the [PlayStation 3](http://amzn.to/2eQ58U6) and Router settings.
  
Tricky, but worth it. It's pretty slick. Took a trip down to McD's for this test. Once you make this work, you can technically use this anywhere. Streamed off FreeNAS.

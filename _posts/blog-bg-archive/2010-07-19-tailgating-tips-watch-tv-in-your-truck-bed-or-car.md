Have a truck or vehicle with a power outlet ?
Like tailgating,bbq,or camping ?
Here is a vid showing how you can quickly set up OTA HD cable in your vehicle.
  
With a couple pieces of equipment like the Hauppauge 1191 HVR950Q HDTV USB TV Tuner it can be easy ! As you can see in this video, I set this up in about 30 seconds.

This has potential. Just a single monitor drawing power off the battery. Probably not much different than blasting your stereo at a tailgate party.

Maybe you have that friend who hasn't picked up his copy of [NCAA 11](http://ncaafootball.easports.com/home.action) or god forbid he doesn't play sports games. Sharing video highlights of that great catch you had in the National Championship game has been relatively easy through [EA Sports World](http://www.easportsworld.com).

However, most of the video clips watched on the internet takes place over at [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/booyagadget). In this Booya Video I am going to show you how to take those highlights from the EA site and upload them to YouTube so that the rest of the world can savor in your greatness.

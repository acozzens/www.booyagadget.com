The Zxing Barcode Scanner is worth it, but likely used only once in a while. I think scanning barcodes is like popping bubble rap, pop-its and getting your first Label Maker.

I found myself scanning anything I could around the house. But in Real Life, would I use this ? Yes, I would. It's not going to change your life, but it can be used as a utility application in your everyday life.

I have wanted the [Hauppauge HD-PVR](http://amzn.to/2ec7myT) for a long time, and finally got it. I love it. It is an expensive gadget at somewhere around $200, but worth it if you are looking to record PS3, Xbox, or make your own HD BluRay.  This thing flat out records HD.

The setup was fast, and pretty easy if you're used to working with video cables. The quality of the recordings are strong, you can find sample footage on YouTube, but it is certainly High Def! I would puke before hooking up the yellow composite again.  I am a proud owner.

The other downside are the optional/required accessories, mainly cabling. You can shop around for sure, if you're patient, you can order much cheaper than an in-store pickup. Personally, I must have it NOW :)
  
I bought 3 extra sets of cables to maximize use the [Hauppauge HD-PVR](http://amzn.to/2ec7myT).

**1. 12 foot USB extenstion cable. so I can sit on the couch while playing and recording**

**Booya Review:**
* **Cost**: Expensive, and optional cables add up ! Cheaper in a year or two.
* **Real Life purpose**: Yes, if you want to record in HD, or make bluRay this is the tool.
* **Speed/Time** : Hmm, recording video has slight delay, but shouldn't matter for you. The downside is that these files can get BIG, so manipulating or moving the video can take time.
* **Cool factor** : Probably not very cool to the average Joe, but if you are a gamer, or video editing-phile, then yes it is cool !
* **Easy?** : Not quite HD recording for dummies, but not DNA analyzation either.
* **Dependable?** : So far, works great&#8230; Just update drivers before turning loose.
* **Size/Weight?** : I am pleased with the small size of the HDPVR. It fits in well its new home amongst a few other components beneath the TV.

**RATING: 5/7 Booyas Bottom Line: A Great device IF it fits into your budget.**

_\* UPDATE DEC 2010 \*_ 
  
After owning this device for several months now and totally putting it through the Booya Grinder, I still love this device. If you need to record any gameplay or other devices in high def with component cables, then YES, thumbs up. This is one of the favorite gadgets that I own.

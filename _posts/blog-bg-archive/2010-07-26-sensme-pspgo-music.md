[SensMe](http://www.playstation.com/psp-app/sensme/en/){:target="_blank"} is Music Application for your PSP and PSPgo. It sorts your music by Tempo and Mood much like Pandora and Slacker radio.  Unlike Pandora and Slacker radio, SensME uses your music catalog.

Using Sony's [Media Go](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/products/mediago/default_enu.asp?page=download){:target="_blank"} software users can sync their music to any PSP, PSPgo.  Media Go software will add the information to your music so that SensMe can organize it by mood. The categories included in the App:

  * **Favorites** You can set these by pressing up on a song with the D-Pad
  * **Dance**
  * **Emotional**
  * **Energentic**
  * **Night & Day** This category will change based on the time of day
  * **Shuffle**
  * **Relax**
  * **Upbeat**
  * **Extreme**
  * **Newly Added**

Want to see the App in action, check the video.  I think this App is a great way to listen to your music.  I personally own a [PSP](http://amzn.to/2eS2ugv) with 32gb of storage space so in addition to tons of games and videos I have a very sizable music collection on my PSP.  Plug the PSP into your stereo system and hit the mood you want and this is a great set it and forget App.  If you have the AV cables you can display your PSP onto your HDTV and enjoy the User interface that reflects the mood of the music, complete with Album Cover Art.

So as a quick and successful test, I found it a nice feature that I was able to login to my [FreeNAS](http://freenas.org/){:target="_blank"} shuttle box, via my [MyTouch 3G Slide](https://www.t-mobile.com/){:target="_blank"} Android from TMobile. In this case I was done with the box for the night and decided to shut it down via my myTouch.

Obviously not only can you shut the box down, but you can access all the control features using your Android,Blackberry,iPhone or any other phone with WiFi and a browser.

If you are running a NAS box that uses an HTTP interface on your local network you should try this out with your smart phone.

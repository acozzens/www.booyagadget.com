**Beginning August 4, T-Mobile will send an over-the-air (OTA) update to myTouch 3G Slide customers**, which will provide a number of benefits, including increased battery performance and enhancements to software features such as Faves Gallery and Genius Button. _This is not an update to the Android operating system (i.e. This is not Froyo/Android version 2.2)_.

The update will be sent to customers beginning August 4 and we anticipate all customers will receive it by August 19. Customers will be notified of the OTA via a free SMS text message from T-Mobile.

The timeline for receiving the OTA cannot be expedited. T-Mobile will be unable to manually push the software to customers who ask to receive it before August 19.

Improvements included with this update are as follows:

**Battery Life:** 
* Updates to the T-Mobile online contact backup connection, which will improve battery life. 

**Wi-Fi:** 
* Ability to send MMS messages when connected to Wi-Fi.

**Genius Button improvements:**
* Ability to turn GPS on and off using your voice, such as “Turn GPS on.”
* Will announce Caller ID for incoming voice calls and allow you to “Answer” or “Ignore” using your voice.
* Will announce incoming text messages and allow you to “reply” with dictation.

**Faves Gallery improvements:** 
* The Faves icon will be displayed beside notifications that appear while the device is locked to indicate that the communication is coming from one of your Faves.
* Fave photo display speed will be enhanced.
* General stability will be improved, including more seamless scrolling and consistent display of photos.

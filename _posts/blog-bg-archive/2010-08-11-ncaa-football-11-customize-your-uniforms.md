excerpt: "EA Sports NCAA Football 11 has added and polished some great features when it comes to customizing the game experience. This is one reason I love NCAA 11so much, because you can really make it feel like a true College Football game with sound effects, kickoff songs, and tweaking the uniforms to look just like your favorite team."

2 key positions we like to customize are the fullback and linebacker positions. It's really easy to do and looks great. Obviously, you can customize any position's uniform, we just tend to start with LB and FB at minimum. It looks sweet.

Below are pics and a nice video demonstration with highlights. In the menu, navigate to TEAM MANAGEMENT / EDIT ROSTERS / THEN GO TO THE UNIFORM TAB

excerpt: "Recent PS3 Dynamic theme release Clash of the Titans is an OK theme. The main action in this PS3 dynamic theme is Medusa slithering around with Snake Hairdo waving. It doesn't crack my top 4 favorite themes. But it is another option depending on your taste."

Like most PS3 themes, it helps a lot if you're really into the game or movie the theme is based on. I picked this up from the Playstation Store for a few bucks and it is available now. I wasn't big into themes until I joined Playstation Plus, now I check a lot of them out. So far, Beach Breeze dynamic theme is my favorite.

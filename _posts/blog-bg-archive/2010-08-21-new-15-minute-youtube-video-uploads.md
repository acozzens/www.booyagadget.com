My thoughts are mostly around the PS3 (Xbox) with some good game footage. Imagine you could make a 15 minute NCAA 11 Football Highlight Reel after a season on your PS3 or Xbox. You could also do thorough level walkthroughs for tough levels.

Booya Gadget likes this video upgrade, it's great for gamers on Playstation, or XBOX. It's great for everyone.

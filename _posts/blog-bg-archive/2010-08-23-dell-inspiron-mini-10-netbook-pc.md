This Netbook purchase is a good example of how we do things here at BooyaGadget. As you may have noticed we are not a typical review site. Most review sites are very broad and generic, while at BooyaGadget we focus more on the versatility of a gadget.

Which brings me to the Dell MINI 10.

Here at BooyaGadget we are all digital. ALL DIGITAL. Movies, Music, Pictures. We constantly look for ways to make our gadget fit that Digital lifestyle. The Dell MINI 10 excels in that department.

The Dell MINI 10 is a small netbook with a 10.1" screen. It measures 14.5 x 9.4 x 3.8. A small Netbook is good for web surfing, blogging, email. However, at BooyaGadget we like to push our gadgets so here are a few things I tested on the MINI 10.

The MINI comes equiped with a TV Tuner built in, which they call "Dell Digital TV". I plugged in the antenna, let it scan for my local channels and Booya! I had OTA TV. I was watching all my local HD channels in my backyard.

This Dell netbook also comes equipped with an HDMI port so you are able to send outbound audio and video signals via an HDMI cable.

Plugged this into my HDTV and used it as a second monitor. The HDMI port carries both the video and the audio so you can watch and hear all your youtube clips on your HDTV.

I think I am going to have alot of fun with this little Netbook.

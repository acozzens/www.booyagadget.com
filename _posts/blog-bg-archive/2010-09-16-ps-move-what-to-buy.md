Your options will be based on what you already own or don't own. PS Move is being sold ala carte as well in bundles.

**Please note, this is an old article! Some or all aspects may be obsolete especially pricing, but liks are fresh to Amazon.**

If you don't own any Playstation equipment then the easiest option may just be the [PlayStation 3 - 320 GB System/PlayStation Move Bundle](http://amzn.to/2ixEUuo){:target="_blank"}.

This box will set you back between $180 and $399.99 (depending on new or used) and it comes with everything you need to get up and running. This bundle has your PS3, 1 Dualshock3 Controller, 1 PS Move Controller, 1 PS Eye, Sports Champions.

If you already own a PS3 then this Move Starter Pack could be just right for you.

[This bundle from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2in43aj){:target="_blank"} has 1 PS Move Controller, 1 PS Eye, and Sports Champions.

Finally if you are like me and already own a PS Eye then the best solution could be ala carte.

Just buying the PS Move controller will cost you less than $40 and a copy of Sports Champions is less than $20. Saving you money since you already own the PS Eye.

So what are the guys at BooyaGadget going to do? Like I said, I already own a PS Eye so I will be picking up 2 Move Controllers, and 1 copy of Sports Champions. Going the ala carte way is going to set me back $139.97.

There are going to be plenty of accessories for the PS Move to consider,the Dualshock 3 can be used as a Navigation controller. I am going to try that first to see if I really need to buy the Navigation Conroller. Our original Playstation Move articles and videos were very highly viewed, so check out the [search page](/search/) for "PS3 Move".

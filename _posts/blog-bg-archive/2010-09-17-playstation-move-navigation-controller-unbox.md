At the time of this article, I use my PS3 for all my home media streaming as well, so I will try the [nav controller](http://amzn.to/2jStkH8){:target="_blank"} as the primary device for a while.

You can use the PS3 Move in the same way, but it is not as precise as using the Navigation Controller as it requires flicking the sphere to scroll the XMB. Â At this time, I can't call the Nav Controller a must have, but it's a slick little device that is worth consideration at under $20, but not worth losing the house over.

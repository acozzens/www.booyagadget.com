I'm glad I have this [Playstation Move Charging station](http://amzn.to/2jq4NfS){:target="_blank"}, at least somewhere to safely store and charge the PS3 Move wands and nav controller. The Playstation Move Charging station is not a must have. But it is nice to have. Personally, I wouldn't want these expensive gadgets damaged and laying around on the ground. The "ping-pong ball" looking globe is not that tough and could be easily smashed.

If you have the budget, grab the ps3 move charging station and keep these rubberized and oversized ping pong balls safe. Â  **Expect costs to be Under $20 USD**

**OTHER OPTIONS**
There are many other knock-off charging stations available as well.
I can't vouch for their quality but i'm sure there are some decent options, I prefer Sony label stuff in general, but these are for your consideration..

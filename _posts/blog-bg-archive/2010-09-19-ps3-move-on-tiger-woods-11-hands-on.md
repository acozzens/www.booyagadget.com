There is a learning curve that will take some time to invest in figuring out how to use the [Playstation Move](http://amzn.to/2izsX81){:target="_blank"} to get up and down the golf course on Tiger.

I struggled to chip and putt, and driving was tough. I just haven't put in the required time yet. I wouldn't buy a Move just to play Tiger, it's just another nice option to have depending on your gaming preferences.

If you own the [EA Sports Tiger Woods 11](http://amzn.to/2jx0ZsL){:target="_blank"} already then you should definitely play 18 holes using the PS3 Move Controller to see what you think.

excerpt: "Volleyball is a hidden gem in Sports Champions on PS3. It’s relatively easy to learn ( recommend tutorial first ) and can get competitive fast. I found that playing on Silver/medium difficulty was a nice match that featured some competitive rallies with the computer."

The most sad thing with [Sports Champions](http://amzn.to/2jIG2LB){:target="_blank"} is the lack of online multiplayer support! That is a crying shame. In general, I have found that the [Playstation Move](http://amzn.to/2jyDEoT){:target="_blank"} works very well, including accuracy and consistency. I've tested with a little and a lot of light.

I don't know that I'd buy a PS3 and Move just to play volleyball, but it is a solid little game and is fun when competitive.  Equal or just a step down from Archery, but to each his/her own.

Serving is pretty straightforward as is the bump set and spike requirements.

**Here is our video,  with [Sports Champions gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/embed/33cWS0y4WZo){:target="_blank"} so you can see how it works !**

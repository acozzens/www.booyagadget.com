excerpt: "Tumble is simply a building block / puzzle game. You build towers, or even destroy them. It's pretty easy to learn and simple in concept, but is not necessarily easy, it can get tricky."

Available now at the [Playstation Store, Tumble](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tumble-ps3/){:target="_blank"} is likely not the flagship game of every [Playstation Move](http://amzn.to/2jBLFJr){:target="_blank"} owner, but it costs less than a full retail game and can be another option for you before more games come out or offer Move support.

A big part of the game is simply building tricky towers, for example in this image I must build up and around this laser that is sweeping back and forth.

So there are several game modes to the Playstation's Tumble game. Â Mainly you build, destroy, or simply bounce the laser / Move around requiring patience and accuracy through other challenges.

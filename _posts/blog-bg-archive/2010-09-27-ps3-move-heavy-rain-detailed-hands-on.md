> In Heavy Rain, you need to have complete and full command of the necessary PS3 Move commands or people will probably die.

One of my favorite features is that with [Heavy Rain](http://amzn.to/2j9oRCo){:target="_blank"} I can finally play with the Move while sitting on my booty relaxing. In fact, that's a tip, get comfortable, rest your dominant hand easily on your leg/knee.  The main downside we found so far is that some key-press combinations are too tough.  For instance, if you wanted to cut off your finger ( hypothetically ) you have to hold the Move button, and Triangle then move the wand, it's tricky, and I don't want to have a character die on me because I couldn't operate the Move.

Good experience, definitely worth a try.  Heavy Rain is one of our favorite games at Booya Gadget, so I was happy to download the LARGE patch for Move compatibility.  I can't describe everything here, so best way to learn is to go fire up your copy of Heavy Rain and pair your Move / Nav, it will add tension to a tense game.  If you have never played Heavy Rain, I recommend it if you can go on a binge.  It's kind of like watching a movie, except you're the actor.

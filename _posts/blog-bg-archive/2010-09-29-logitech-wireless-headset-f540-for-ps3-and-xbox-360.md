> Logitech says you'll get 10 hours of game play off of one single charge.

The built in re-chargeable battery means that you won't be tangled up in wires. Not to worry though, if you end up in a late night bender and the power runs out, you can plug in the headset and continue using the device while it re-charges.

Logitech says you'll get 10 hours of game play off of one single charge. The new headset will set you back approximately $139.99 and is available on [amazon](http://amzn.to/2jLynMv){:target="_blank"}..

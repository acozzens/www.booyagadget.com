excerpt: "I was surprised that I ended up loving Red Dead Redemption on Playstation 3.  I tend not to be much of a sandbox game lover.  I think it's just something about the Wild Wild West, that captured my attention and RDR kept me hooked for a few weeks.  Then Rockstar was nice enough to pump out the online multiplayer Co-Op patch for free!"

Big thumbs up for the co-op mission patch. Very fun, would be even more fun with a full group of 4-5 cowboys!
If you've never played Red Dead consider giving it a rental, or [download RDR from Playstation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/red-dead-redemption-ps3/){:target="_blank"}.
For some reason I just cannot stand the older Grand Theft Auto games, they're simply not fun to me, but being out in the Wild West on horseback with Old-School guns hit a hot button for me.

> One of my favorite other features of the Red Dead is the excellent graphics quality of the horses.

It plays well, requires teamwork and as usual it's always best to play Co-Op with in-game voice chat, or Skype, whichever flavor you prefer. One of my favorite other features of the Red Dead is the excellent graphics quality of the horses.

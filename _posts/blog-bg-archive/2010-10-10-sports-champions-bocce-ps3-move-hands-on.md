It is easy, simple and fast. A great demo if you wanted to show someone the Move for the first time.

It takes 2-3 games to get the hang of it, but learning is swift.  If you think the game is too plain, then make sure to utilize the Custom Music option in the settings and Jam to your favorite beats.  Although if you're playing this game with friends, then music may not be necessary, unless you turn it into a drinking game or something. You can order the [PlayStation Move Starter Bundle on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2kzfCJB){:target="_blank"}

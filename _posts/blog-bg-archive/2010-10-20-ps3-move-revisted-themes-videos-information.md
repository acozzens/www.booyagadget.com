We started off with the peripherals, the Charging station and the Nav Controller. Then came Sports Champions which is a favorite, mix in Tiger Woods 11, Heavy Rain, Tumble and more.. This article is one of the best sources of real life demonstrations of the PS3 Move, so make sure you check out the Video Playlist in the links below, or make a request.

Overall, we're very impressed with the Move for the Playstation.  It's accuracy and responsiveness is excellent, and this is the most important aspect of the controller. It does have a drawback which is light sensitivity, but under "normal" conditions it is a non-factor.  With Move's accuracy, it allows you to play any compatible Game out there. 
  
It's not designed for just baby games and throwing Bocce.  It can roll on Heavy Rain, MAG, and Tiger Woods 11.  All games that you don't want to worry about accuracy. That's why i'm concerned about the quality of the Kinect.  Can it keep up with fast pace games or will you get waxed because it wasn't fast enough ?  PS3 Move is impressive.  Booya!

This rewards program will eventually be available to every PSN subscriber, but the first to taste this new treat are Playstation Plus and Gamer Advisory Panel Members. If you are in these groups you will be receiving an invitation email.

The program is set to reward those gamers that game, buy and communicate the most on the Playstation Network.  There will be three tiers Select, Pro and Legendary.  Your tier status will then give you access to exclusive content.  Avatars, Dynamic Themes, Playstation Home content and other Playstation merchandise.   The first big sweepstakes give-away will be an all expense paid trip to the 2011 Consumer Electronic Show.

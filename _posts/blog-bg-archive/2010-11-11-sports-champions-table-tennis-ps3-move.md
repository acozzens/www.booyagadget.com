10 years ago, I would never have expected to be playing virtual ping-pong in my living room.   Have you seen Total Recall ?  Early on there's a scene with Schwarzenegger's wife receiving virtual tennis instructions.  Well, that is available right now, here in the year 2010.

Our video at the bottom of this article shows real gameplay.

The reason I'm so hyped up about this game, is because of its difficulty. This is not far off of real ping pong. I went into the silver cup pretty cocky after easily gliding through Bronze.  Well, Sports Champions does crank it up a notch later.  As you advance, you'll see more returns, better defense, increased spin shots, and some guaranteed frustration.  Word on the streets is that the Gold Cup features a nasty Final BOT-BOSS type setup.  I haven't reached that computer serving device yet, but it will be an intense game of man vs machine.

All I need is my white headband and my glowing PS3 Move controller.  **Sports Champions Table Tennis sets the bar for motion controller sports**.  I have played them all, and I'm floored by my ability to play ping pong vs my TV. If you have ping pong skills, then I can't wait to hear your feedback when you too reach the Gold Cup.  This game is flat out impressive.

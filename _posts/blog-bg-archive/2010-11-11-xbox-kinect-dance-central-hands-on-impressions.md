excerpt: "When it comes to Kinect's new motion sensor peripheral, fitness and dance really get to shine. Personally I do not tend to be a Dance game person, but I certainly am a big fan of Music and similar rhythm games."

 Once again I was impressed with Microsoft's Kinect system's ability to easily track my movements, and my funky dance moves. So, knowing that the game works, let's move on to the nuts n bolts. Dance Central, by Harmonix, is already a big hit, and it's reall not a surprise.

First off Harmonix is the leader in rhythm games. Rock Band has cost me a few hundred dollars over time, and they keep getting my money with DLC. The #1 factor in any music/rhythm game is DLC.

As usual, the opening lineup of songs to dance to can get boring real quick. Sure, I'm down to tear up a little Bel Biv Devoe "Poison", but after 10 times, It can get boring. However, once again, this is the big value in having Harmonix be the developer. There is no doubt they will leverage their already solid and constantly improving music DLC library. The downside is that it costs money to get the new jams. So, if you're a youngster, you better plan on doing extra chores, but for the older crowd, you can just sit back and pick and choose your favorite songs to boogie down to, assuming you have a gaming budget.

Keep an eye out at the Harmonix [Dance Central](http://www.dancecentral.com/){:target="_blank"} website to stay in tune with updates and new DLC which I'm sure will pump out on a regular basis. Â Enjoy your copy of Dance Central.

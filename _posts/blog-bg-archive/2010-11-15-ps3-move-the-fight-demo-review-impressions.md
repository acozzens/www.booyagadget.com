excerpt: "I'm still a little bit in shock about IGN's review of this game at 3/10, I found it didn't make sense, so I hope you stumble on this before writing The Fight off from consideration."

If it were a movie, I might say rent it first, but I think some people may really enjoy this game.  I will review a game that I don't like, but I won't rate it badly because it's not my type.  I'll tell you right now I give it a 7/10 which I consider to be a solid "C".  A 3/10 from a major review is why Booya has over [25,ooo views per month on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/BooyaGadget).  I do own this game and I feel compelled to drive it as far as I physically can.  Speaking of that, this game will boost your [trophies](http://www.ps3trophies.org/game/the-fight-lights-out/trophies/){:target="_blank"} too, I got a silver trophy (Slayer) and a few bronze as well in the first 2 hours of playing.

One thing IGN did get right in their [review of The Fight](http://ps3.ign.com/objects/064/064975.html){:target="_blank"} is that [Danny Trejo](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001803/){:target="_blank"} definitely goes overboard in the tutorial, and I loved every minute of it.  I love Danny Trejo, and he's such a great fit for this game.  Yeah, it's silly showing hardcore street fighting with glowing orbs in your hand and the developers of The Fight knew that.  What a great tutorial, so memorable.  Personally my favorite Trejo films are [Blood in Blood out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106469/){:target="_blank"}, and his cameo in [Bubble Boy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258470/){:target="_blank"}. But he's probably best known for playing in [From Dusk Till Dawn](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/){:target="_blank"}.

I was very curious about this game because I think it's the first of its kind using any motion controllers.  Having tested the Kinect Your Shape Fitness, I found that in general, the punching style was similar at first but much more complex using the Move.  **Punching blocks, punching faces, definitely had the same vybe, but as usual the Playstation Move takes it to the next level.** Most special moves require a squeezing of a trigger or pushing of the button while simultaneously trying to knock homeboy out. I've never played a game like this before, it is part Fight Night, and part Fitness, while throwing in a certain "I don't know what" as well.  This game is not like any I've played before in my living room. I will tell you right now, you will be sore after playing.  I feel like I did about 75 dips in one night. I'm sore, but it's a good sore!

<strong>PS3 MOVE: THE FIGHT TALE OF THE TAPE:</strong>

<strong>The Good:</strong>
* Very unique game
* Excellent upper body workout, seriously.
* Yes, has Multiplayer online, yes, I got worked twice already
* 7/10  Solid "C"  This will be right up some people's alley.  I plan on going trophy hunting on it.
* Some easy Bronze and Silver trophies to go grab early.  I got "Lucky", and "Slayer" right off the bat.
* Mix between, Fight Night, and Some Fitness Game.
* What a treat for Danny Trejo fans, one of my favorite tutorials in any Move game so far.

<strong>The Bad:</strong>
* Forces full install on first load, just took a while.
* Feet must stay in one spot.. This is awkward, if I were fighting I would move a lot.
* The game is a little dark, a little "Fight Noir"
* If you want to play 2 players at home on Split Screen, you need a whopping 4 Move controllers.
* This game requires a minimum of 2 Moves for single player
* The "long" calibration is awkward, and I've not yet found the right environment for head tracking.  Not being functional is a major whammy violation.  In general, this is a good example of bad Move calibration.  They maybe should have waited another 6 months, and at least allowed me to fight without being stationary.  A Kinect version of this game would smoke The Fight.  Kinect is great at full body action, and this game shows a weakness in the <strong>Full Body abilities of the Move vs Kinect</strong>.

Let me say one more time, this game is NOT a 3/10, it's also not a 9/10.    I traded in Ruse, and Brunswick Bowling already I didn't like them, but The Fight I will be keeping around a while.  Now, I need some rest and Ibuprofen, because my shoulders and back need a break from my training to make this video for you..  Booya.  7/10  "Give it a shot, rent it if you can first, but be open to buying it."

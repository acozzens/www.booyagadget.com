Good Job goes to EA Support for having a quick resolution of my problem importing my Rock Band 2 songs into Rock Band 3.  I wanted my 70 RB2 Track import no doubt.  As we mentioned in our [Kinect Dance Central article](/2010/11/xbox-kinect-dance-central-hands-on-impressions.html), **downloadable content is the key factor** to music and rhythm based games. So, having an additional 70 imported Rock Band 2 songs was really not even an option for me, it was a must have!  **So, I was very rattled when I grabbed my dusty RB2 sleeve**, entered the DLC Code on the back of the insert and got a whammy message !  I did some quick Googling and was pretty confident that [SUPPORT.EA.COM](https://help.ea.com/en/){:target="_blank"} was gonna be able to help me, and, they did, that is +1 Booya point. Although the issue shouldn't have happened in the first place.

Per the instructions I went to www.rockband.com/ps3-export (this rockband page is non longer active) and entered the 16 digit code on the back of my Rock Band 2 insert. But it kept giving me that terrible code:  "Something's Wrong.  That game code was not found. Please Try Again". ARRGH.. I double triple checked, went all upcase etc..

**The solution**, was to hit up [EA Support](https://help.ea.com/en/){:target="_blank"}, login with my ancient account after having to submit a "what's my user name" request.   After digging up my old account info, I just sent an email describing the exact scenario&#8230;The  next day, no questions asked,  I had a new code. I uploaded over 1GB today when I got home.   Good Solution, and it worked well.  It should not have happened and it sounds like a common occurrence, so a database developer may have gotten fired over this one.  **What a headache, I am not the only one it happened to.  BUT, in their defense, the fixed it quick** and now I'll just give them some props on swift problem resolution.

**Don't forget, this ain't free.  Exporting your Rock Band 2 songs into Rock Band 3 will cost you $9.99** on [PSN/Playstation Network](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/search/?q=rock%20band){:target="_blank"}.  So be prepared for that, but for me, it's a sunk cost.  I love Rock Band and having my favorite jams is a must have and a great stress reliever !  I don't know about you, but I blast my RB3 using headphones mainly, helps rocking the drums.

###### UPDATE!!
**NOTE: The Rock Band 2 export pack is no longer available for purchase.**  Only users who previously purchased the Rock Band 2 export pack can re-download the pack for use in Rock Band 4.  Re-downloading the Rock Band 2 export pack is currently not supported through the in-game Rock Band Music Store. The pack can only be re-downloaded through either the PlayStation®Network Store using your web browser or via the PlayStation®Network Store on your PlayStation®4 console.

What's your favorite Rock Band Jam ?  A few of mine are Doobie Brothers, Pearl Jam "Alive", "Cherub Rock", nearly all Boston and "Pick up the Pieces" on drums.. ( because [Rock Band Keyboard is great too](/2010/10/rockband-3-keyboard-unbox-first-impression.html) )

I'm off to go enjoy my copy or Rock Band 3, with the additionally Imported (70) Rock Band 2 Songs :)  Look out Testify on Expert Drums!  Kumbaya RB2 Disc.

Here is [Harmonix Official page on export importing Rock Band Versions](https://harmonix.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217577718-How-do-I-export-Rock-Band-2-into-Rock-Band-4-){:target="_blank"}

A few extra screenshots from my experience. If they look familiar, you weren't alone if you had problems.  But in the end EA did Booya the support well.

**BIO:**  
*Quiet and serious, Rin is something of an enigma.  Far and away the most serious competitor among the group, Rin cares little for fame and adulation.  She only accepted this challenge out of a sense of duty, and the hope of representing her beliefs with dignity and valor.  Although Rin is soft spoken and reserved, she is one of the fiercest and hungriest competitors in the field.*

**Home:** Bucharest, Romania  
**Age / Sex:** 18, Female  
**Height / Weight:** 5'4", 105 lbs  
**Primary Sport:** Gymnastics  
**Strengths:** Agility, Speed  
**BIO:**  
*While certainly one of the most determined contestants, Belle's driven nature sometimes gets out of hand.  Forced into a state-run gymnastics program from an etremely young age, Belle never really developed the normal behavior and social skills of other girls her age and instead focused all her efforts on winning.  Groomed from the outset to be an Olympic Champion, she sees the competition as a waste of time and is only here to maintain favor with the directors of her school.  Feisty and bratty, she has an enormous sense of entitlement and only makes friends when she needs something.*

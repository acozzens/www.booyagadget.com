excerpt: "Pass, kick, defend, shoot. That is Kinect Sports Soccer in 4 words. There is no dribbling, outside of slight lateral movements. Once again this highlights, Kinect's focus on casual, party style gaming."

It is fun, but I'd recommend playing the Target Kick mini-game mode if you wanted to get your visitor's heart rate up.  Soccer is "OK" but a little too casual for my taste.  Yes, I would play this game for sure to get some easy trophies and casually show off the system to a friend.  **But when your company leaves, Soccer may not be the game mode you pick up** and play.

This game shines in its simple, easy, and fun natured spirit. I'd say it would be more popular with younger kids, or Soccer loving Kinect hooligans.  I may go hunting for some simple achievements, but this Futbol game won't get a lot of play in my house.  To each his or her own, however, this game will hit the spot for some gamers or families out there.  I will admit, things got competitive during our filming.  That's one thing I really like about casual games is that they're so easy to pick up and play that competition really can heat up quick between two ( or more for multiplayer ) players.    When playing the mini-game "Target Kick" I thought my 22 goals was pretty good, until my Booya Gadget volunteer put in 27.  Well, I can't have that in my own house, I know I can get better than 27!

I am serious when I recommend this, **stretch and maybe even warm up before playing this game**.  I am out of shape, and it has been many many years since I kicked a Soccer ball 50-100 times in a 1 hour period.  Uhhh,  ouch I was definitely sore from my boo-tay to my toes.  The other for genuine tip I have is that for Kinect Sports you really should safely clear your play area.  When you get heated up, there is a chance you kick a lamp, soda, beer, or glass of red wine.  I guarantee it will happen to someone, somewhere !

Soccer is OK, good for casual, young gamers. More mature, or competitive gamers could get bored after the demonstration.

It should be known that I switched to Google from YouMail's free version which I really loved. Considering Google Voice as only a visual voicemail tool, it is great. But WOW the transcribing is just plain bad, not even on the cusp. I'm actually quite surprised, because when I think of Google, I just can't equate them to a half-quality product. I will show you some samples, as well as link the actual voicemail so you can see the transcribe feature struggling for yourself.

There is one main feature(besides a complete transcribing overhaul) that could **help Google Voice right now, and that is customized greetings for their callers**. That is the #1 reason I loved YouMail. You simply linked your email contacts with YouMail and a very sexy female voice would automatically greet your callers with their own name based on your contact list in a wonderful British accent. My friends loved it, and they always wanted to meet my ficticious secretary. I would be satisfied if Google simply added that feature right now and fixed their transcribing later. Trust me, you'd love it. Custom greetings by name is far better than rudely greeting your callers with music they don't enjoy like a few friends of mine use.

Yes, Google's voicemail system integrates very well ( auto setup ) with my Android, and I love that I can listen to voicemails online, I have to give credit.  So if that's what you care most about, then sign up with confidence.  **If you roll with the stock voicemail from your Cell Provider, then I recommend giving Voice a trial run for sure**. The voice transcriptions are indeed terrible, but they are good for determining whether or not you should even listen to the voicemail and that is the major benefit. However, the fact that I have to "dig" for a benefit is not good.  Some of my callers transcribe very well, and others, like myself with a deep raspy voice get translated to text terribly. I even have some computer-to-computer examples for you to sift through.

I like Google Voice a lot, just wish they would  "Google It" and make it the best product out there.  I'm trying to say that the poor quality of the transcription is just not Google's style.  **The transcribing is so bad, it is indeed a half worthless feature.** Deep down, I have confidence that Google will fix this. As a Documentary lover, I know for a fact that the technology to transcribe voice is out there since the government is using it for sure.  Because the transcribing is so sketchy, I am unfortunately, considering a switch back to YouMail because the reactions from the custom greetings is more valuable than the transcriptions at this time.  I'll give it a few more months before giving up.  Without a 75% increase in transcribing accuracy Google Voice is no different than any other free Voicemail product out there.

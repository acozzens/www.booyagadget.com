The short and sweet answer is that The Sony Dash is an internet station, something you put on your nightstand or place on the kitchen counter.   It sports a 7" touch screen and has access to thousands of apps from the Chumby library.  You can check your Gmail, update your Facebook status, listen to music from Pandora or watch videos from Hulu Plus and Netflix.  It does all of this from its built in WiFi network.

With this short Booya I am going to show you how to connect and play your PSP videos on your Sony Dash.  The Sony Dash has a USB slot that allows you to connect your PSP.  Set your PSP to USB mode and then work to the Video menu on your Sony Dash.  Select the USB button and The Sony Dash will search your PSP device.

Once The Dash finds your device it will allow you to search your PSP directories.  This will be familiar to any user that has searched these directories from their Home PC.  Scroll down to the Video folder.  Select the Video folder and you will have access to your entire video collection on your PSP.

From this list you can select the movie that you wish to watch.  The Dash will begin playing the file.  This will work for pictures and music as well.  You do have to select USB under the right media tab on the Sony Dash.  For example, you can only listen to music if you have selected USB under the Music Tab on your Sony Dash.

One great trick I learned while playing with this Booya.  I own a PSPgo, which has 16 gb of memory.  I have installed an additional 16 gb memory card making my PSP a 32 gb device.  When the PSP is plugged into the Dash and set to USB mode before you select USB on the Sony Dash you will get all of the files on your System Memory.  If you select USB on your Sony Dash before setting your PSP to USB mode you will get all of the files on your removable Memory Card.  I am not sure why this works, but I did try it several times and continued to get the same results.  This is a nice work-around since there is no other way to select which memory you would like to access on the PSP.

An added bonus is that your PSP will charge during this set-up.  This will only work with your personal video and music collections, the Sony Dash did not recognize any of my PSN Video files.  If you are interested in compressing your own videos for playback on your [PSP and Sony Dash we have a tutorial](/2010/11/stream-movies-to-your-android-with-tversity.html).

Booya Cuz is our Table Tennis expert and he has spent many hours with both the PS Move and the Xbox Kinect and their respective Table Tennis games.  This week Booya Gadget released a new Sports Champions Table Tennis video that will concentrate on more advanced serving techniques.

**Sports Champions Table Tennis Advanced Serving**

Booya Cuz uses a "topspin heavy" shot to serve the ball.  By simply flicking his wrist at a 45 degree angle he is able to create this high velocity shot.  Watch his latest video to get a better grasp on this technique and make yourself a better Table Tennis player.

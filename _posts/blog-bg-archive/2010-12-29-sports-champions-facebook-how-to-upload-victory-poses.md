 However, it's a little tricky so if you find yourself here, know that I had to ask the same question.  The task, in general, is not complicated but I will show you how to do it, as well as the Gotcha's involved which can foil your plan.

I will begin with the #1 GOTCHA that I found:  you can't upload your pictures to Facebook if you skipped this step after winning a Cup Championship in any mode.  Maybe this will get patched as it should, or the pictures should be accessible from the Playstation XMB Photos tab.  Because I can record all my gameplay with the <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5574915563&toolid=10001&campid=5336761545&customid=&icep_uq=Hauppauge+HD+PVR&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=3281&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg" target="_blank">Hauppauge HD PVR</a><img style="text-decoration: none; border: 0; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="http://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5574915563&toolid=10001&campid=5336761545&customid=&uq=Hauppauge+HD+PVR&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]" alt="" />, I can get around this, but for the average non-blog writing Sports Champs owner you're screwed unless you are OK with snapping a picture of your TV with your Cell Phone.   If you want to know how to EASILY upload ( or simply view ) your classic Victory Poses then I recommend following these simple steps.

**1.  Setup your Facebook Account First.** I linked my accounts going to the PS3 XMB/Dashboard and then PHOTOS.   Once in photos, you can select the UPLOAD option and you will have a choice to link to Picasa and or Facebook.   Select Facebook, and then take a few minutes to add your UserName Password.   This is not required, just easier as you can link your accounts the first time you win a Cup if you never have.

**2.  Whether or not you followed step 1, the next step is to win a Cup.** Of course, you are forced to begin with the Easiest, BRONZE CUP.  This cup is beginner level, and obviously the easiest.  You should be able to win a cup w/in a couple of hours on certain game modes.

* So, if you just want to see all your sweet "Victory Poses" and you have ALREADY won Sports Champions Cup Challenges, then simply start the game like you're going to play..
* Go to CHAMPIONS CUP, select the cup that you won already in the past, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hit SQUARE</span> to see your "VICTORY POSE". Voila.

REMEMBER:  The sad thing is that if you don't upload to facebook when you have the chance ( immediately after winning a cup ) then you can't upload it. ( Developers need to repair this ! )

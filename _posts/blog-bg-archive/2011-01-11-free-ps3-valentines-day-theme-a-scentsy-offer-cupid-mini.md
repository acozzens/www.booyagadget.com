In addition to this theme release we have to mention "Love Cupid" a PSP Mini that is perfectly themed for the holiday.  This is a two player PSP Mini, where player 1 shoots arrows at the bad guys and the floating hearts using the Analog Stick.  Meanwhile player 2 uses the square and circle button to move left and right catching the falling hearts, while avoiding the bad guys.  An awkward set-up that all takes place on one PSP.  However, if you are skilled enough, you can play this game by yourself and easily do both jobs.

Get yourself a preview of the Best Golf Game available on the market for any system.   Yes there's Move support.  Yes there are many new features and remember you will get credit for progress you make with the Demo.

Due to time constraints, it's been reported that Tiger will have **no Kinect support, but will be compatible with Playstation Move**.   Kinect shines in some areas, and not in others.  "Faking" a golf swing with no club would feel a little on the silly side in my opinion, **so I will be acquiring this game for the PS3 with no hesitation.**

Having written many articles and shot nearly [20 HD gameplay reviews of the Move](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF3E97F16B1B51F90){:target="_blank"}, it is something you should consider trying.  It's not a simple task, and requires a little time adjusting to "virtual golf", but using motion controls is a fun and challenging way of playing one of the greatest golf titles anywhere.  One of the biggest complaints I received about the game was putting difficulty.  While I blame my own lack of skill for poor putting performance, others with more skills than me, still feel it was too inconsistent.

For my gaming budget, Tiger 12 is a must buy, but I won't stand in line, nor race for a first day release, but the game will be in my collection sometime after the April 1st Releast date.  And, as usual, it will get the occasional play from me until EA Sports can get $50 more of my hard earned cash with Tiger 13 !  If you are more budget conscious, don't always get the latest and greatest, or commonly by "last year's model" to save dough then to be honest, Tiger 11 is still a valid choice for your money although some features would be a little out-dated.

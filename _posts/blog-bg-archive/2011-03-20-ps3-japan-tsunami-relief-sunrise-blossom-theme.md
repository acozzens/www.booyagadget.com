You can download this static image theme, created by Playstation Network developers at YOUR CHOICE of cost.  100% of the proceeds will to go the American Red Cross to directly aid those affected by the terrible Earthquake-Tsunami-Nuclear Meltdown. There are lots of ways to help, but in this case Booya opted for the $5 option from [playstation network relief themes](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-sa/search/q=relief){:target="_blank"}.  Just imagine if every single PS3 owner purchased this theme.  If you're a youngster on your parent's budget, then tell them you'd like to help, or use your "please can I help" eyes, I think it will go over well.   The purchase options are $2,$5,$10,$25,$50

Here is a video showing you the [most helpful theme you will ever download in your life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE3Lm0KI0Vg):

You get a PS3 theme, and you help a fellow human in need in the process.  That is very very Booya indeed.

** THIS ARTICLE IS VERY OLD NOW, I WOULD NOT TEXT ANY OF THESE WITHOUT VERIFYING FIRST **

  1. American Red Cross Relief: text REDCROSS to 90999 to donate $10
  2. Salvation Army: text JAPAN to 80888
  3. Convoy of Hope: text TSUNAMI or SUNAMI to 50555
  4. World Relief Corp. of National Association of Evangelicals: text WAVE to 50555
  5. GlobalGiving: text JAPAN to 50555 to donate $10
  6. ADRA Relief: text SUPPORT to 85944
  7. GlobalGiving: text JAPAN to 50555
  8. International Medical Corps: text MED to 80888

 10. Save the Children Federation: text JAPAN or TSUNAMI to 20222  **( I DID THIS ONE )**
 11. World Vision: text 4JAPAN or 4TSUNAMI to 2022

I tested option 10 on behalf of Save the Children.  After you text the keyword, you will get a confirmation text back, and you have to reply to seal the deal.  It will have instructions already, but I just responded YES and voila.  I hope I helped someone with this Friggin disaster.
  
Please leave a comment here if you know of other ways, or let us know how you helped.  Counting Sunrise Blossom, i'm in $15 will you match or beat that ? If not, just go for the $2 Sunrise Blossom Theme.

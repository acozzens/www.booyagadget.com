With Spring here at last it is time to push one of my favorite games studios. In 2009 [ThatGameCompany](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/){:target="_blank"} made Flower, a great relaxing game that is perfect for Springtime and should be experienced by all PS3 owners.  It is available for download in the Playstation Store.

Here is a [video demonstration of what is now my favorite Booya Gadget custom Free PS3 Theme for Easter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ym4nMGlLYA "Free PS3 Easter Theme Video Demonstration"){:target="_blank"} / Spring with EGGS!

We can watch movies from our Droid, look at pictures, and listen to music.  Best of all, this app and functionality <strong>comes pre-loaded from Motorola on your Droid 2</strong>!

**A WIFI connection is required for DLNA to work.** 
Step 1 is to turn on your DLNA device, in this case it will be the PS3. Then you need to open the DLNA app on your Android Motorola Droid 2.

If you haven't turned your WIFI connection on you will be asked at this time to switch to WIFI.  Once you are switched make sure that you turn on WIFI-Lock that will keep your phone connected to your DLNA device even if the Android goes to sleep, while you are listening or viewing your content.

**Once you have reached the DLNA screen select "Share Media."**

By default nothing is shared at this point so you will have to select the content you want your DLNA device to see.  In this demo we will take a look at music, photos and video.  **Make sure the content you want is selected with the green checkbox.**

You can then exit out to your home screen and you should notice the little green DLNA icon in your task bar.  Set your phone aside as you are now sharing your content with your DLNA enable devices.  This is going to eat your battery so you may want to plug in your phone if you are planning to DJ the entire party.

To view our Motorola Droid 2 DLNA content we are going to us the PS3.  We can stream videos, look at pictures and listen to music.  At this time I found no way to watch the video in 3GP format, which is still the video format of the phones video recorder.  If DLNA is going to become a standard feature of new smartphones then maybe it is time for Videophones to start recording in a more accepted  format.

To see it all in action check out this short video.  The streaming video is great, the photos look very nice and overall I am very happy with this app.  I am disappointed that you are unable to share the 3GP video that is shot with the phone.  The Motorola Droid 2 can shoot video at 720P and would look very good on a HDTV.

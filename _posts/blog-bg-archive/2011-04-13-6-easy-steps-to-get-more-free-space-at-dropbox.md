Originally(at the time of this article creation) there were 6 tasks that need to be completed, each task will award you 500MB of more Dropbox space with friend referrals granting an extra gig! It is still worth it to take a trip to the free space boosting page.  
* [Sign Up Here](https://db.tt/yPwcBzWr){:target="_blank"}
* Go here to get more dropbox space: [https://www.dropbox.com/getspace](https://www.dropbox.com/getspace){:target="_blank"}

Most of these easy tasks are still available, so here are the original (simple) tasks to do to immediately boost your available drive space.

1. THE BEST:  Refer a friend, get 500MB each.
2. Connect your Twitter account with Dropbox – 128 MB
3. Connect your Facebook account with Dropbox – 128 MB
4. Follow @Dropbox on Twitter – 128 MB
5. Give some feedback why you love Dropbox – 128 MB
6. Post the feedback message to your Facebook Profile – 128 MB
7. Post the feedback message as a tweet to your Twitter profile – 128 MB

Not only do you get a work out, but you get to spend quality time with the people you love most.  Honestly, some of the best times in my life with my wife before we had our son, who is now 16 months old, were riding around on our bikes together.  It was like our own little adventure.

Now not only do we pack up our lunch, water bottles, and rain gear…we can also pack up our son.  Because we have so much fun riding bikes together the purchase of a bike trailer after our son turned one was an absolute must.  Ladies if you really want quality time with your man (especially if he's an outdoor type), this is a great way to get it.  Pick out some decent bikes within your budget (we have his & hers Schwinn Solitare's, $244 @ Wal-Mart, great buy), grab a bike trailer if you have a child and get out there.  I guarantee you'll enjoy yourself and be happy to be exercising; pedaling down the street with a smile on your face.  If your kid is anything like mine…he/she will love it too.

The goal of this article is to show you exactly what you will be getting when you purchase the InStep Sync Bicycle Trailer.  I will show you what's in the box, how to assemble the trailer, how to attach it to your bike, and what it looks like rolling down the street.  I do this because I care.  I love reading reviews of items before I purchase them and I appreciate a thorough and in depth write up.  It helps me feel good about spending my hard earned $$$, especially when buying online (I purchased the trailer from Wal-Mart Site to Store).

##### Cost and Assembly
If you have two kids  would strongly recommend checking out the [InStep Quick N EZ Bike Trailer](http://www.walmart.com/ip/InSTEP-Quick-N-EZ-Plus-Bike-Trailer/14539490){:target="_blank"}, which also received excellent reviews and it's only slightly more expensive $109.54.

So far I have been very impressed with the trailers sturdy build, durability, and ease of use.  The assembly was also surprisingly easy.  The trailer is practically put together for you in the box.  In my opinion the engineering behind the simple yet sturdy design worked perfectly and made getting the trailer from box to street simple and almost fun.  This assembly really should take you no longer then 15 minutes (especially if you use Booya's step by step unbox & assembly video)

The frame and seat are already put together, you just have to fold out the sides snap a bar in place and bam!  You see what it will look like.  The Tires just snap in place, the canopy has buttons…easy to maneuver straps…and some Velcro.

###### Attaching the Trailer to your Bike

The trailer was nearly as easy to attach to my bike as it was to put together.  Basically you will be removing the nut from your back tire, attaching the trailer, and screwing the nut back on…simple right.  Here are some visual step by step instructions to make it even easier:

##### Step 1
Remove the nut and washer from your back tire

##### Step 3
Place the coupler plate on the axle with the big hole on the bottom.  (hard part is alighning the little knobs on the washer with the holes on the plate)

##### 5-Point Safety Harness
If you have a child one or older I am sure you are very familiar with strapping your child in to a car seat.  This process is very similar to the 5-point safety harness for the bike trailer.  The main thing to remember is to adjust the shoulder strap height so it fits properly on your child.  There are 3 different heights you can choose from.

#### Pros
* Cheap (under $100)
* Easy assembly & trailer hitch (you'll be riding the same day you get it)
* 5-point harness is very customizable
* smooth ride, easy pulling
* sturdy, durable, & light weight
* Slick look

#### Cons
* Not absolutely rain proof (my sons feet got a little wet in the rain)
* Tires don't seem high quality (also flat upon arrival)
* You have to undo the canopy to put your child in (not easy to get him/her out quickly)
* Your son/daughter may cry when you stop riding (sorry…can't ride all day son)

#### Summary
This was by far the most fun project I have worked on for Booya Baby.  The feeling of accomplishment after assembly and trailer attachment was fantastic.  What was even better was my sons smiling face as soon as we started riding around.  Going on family bike rides is now the activity I look forward to every weekend (if the weather permits), and it all wouldn't be possible without the very slick, easy to assemble, fun to use InStep Sync Bicycle Trailer.  I would strongly recommend picking up this little gadget so you too can enjoy the outdoors in style with your family.  BOOYA!

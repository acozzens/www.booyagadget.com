excerpt: "SNesoid is the 2nd app by Yongzh that makes our exclusive Must-Have list, of the absolute top apps for Android Tablets.  This also works on other Androids, like myTouch 3g slide, but for optimal playing experience I highly recommend that you consider acquiring both a Wii Motion controller AND a Wii Classic Pro."

This app is a very badass SNES emulator, and the developer is the King of emulation.  SNesoid itself is gone from the market but newer options are available by searching [SNES Emulator on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=SNES%20Emulator&c=apps){:target="_blank"}.  I like the app/game so much I definitely bought the full version to show some love to Yongzh because I love his work.  Regardless, both Nesoid and SNesoid are 2 apps that everyone in the galaxy should have in their arsenal.  You can also find old APK's of SNesoid by sideloading.

* A good app to start with is the [SNES 9x Emulator on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.explusalpha.Snes9xPlus&hl=en){:target="_blank"}

#### HOW TO PLAY GAMES WITH YOUR WII CLASSIC / MOTION CONTROLLER(s)
The downside of this optimal setup, is that you need BOTH a Wii Motion Controller($40) AND a Wii Classic($15). So, that is a legit number for the budget concious but keep in mind with SNesoid this means you can have 100+ SNES games, which makes this app priceless. I'm not even counting the fact that you can use the Wii Motion Plus with [Nesoid](/2011/04/best-xoom-apps-play-nintendo-on-xoom-or-android-with-wii-remote.html) as well!

SNesoid does provide on-screen controls, that you can toggle on or off, but the addition of the "shoulder buttons" in Super Nintendo games makes the Wii controllers the only way to roll.  We already have an guide on [how to connect your Wii remote to your Android](/2011/04/how-to-connect-wii-controller-for-nesoid-android-xoom.html), although it's not specific for using the Wii Classic, the principles are the same and you should be able to complete the task.  If you  are a Motorola Xoom owner rolling the Android 3.0 Honeycomb O.S. I am telling you right now that it works, and it works extremely well, so just pick up the software and hardware and iron out the wrinkles later.  It should not take more than 5-10 minutes to figure out the bluetooth connection, setup and optimization for the first time.  After you figure it out, you'll be setup way faster for future play.

##### Unfortunately, WiiMote is not working on newer droids due to system infrastructure.
_Incompatibility update: Android 4.2+ is not compatible with this app. The reason for this is that Google changed an essential bluetooth component in this version of Android. We are looking for a solution._

#### GAMES
I use both Nesoid and SNesoid in tandem depending on my mood.  The #1 game I play on SNesoid is the friggin all-time classic Super Mario World, and the Final Fantasy/Zelda/Griffey and Super Mario KART. fans out there will be totally pumped as well.  These games are also small files to store on your Tablet or Droid, for about 75 games, I have a folder that takes up only about 150 MB.  So these files are ballpark similar to Mp3 files, some smaller some larger.  Generally the size of these SNES Roms is insignificant.

You'll need to acquire the actual SNES game files which are called "Roms" it's a bit of a shady biz, but you can reach out to friends/forums/ or just do a little google searching to find some test files that you can play.  Obviously without having these games any emulators will be rendered worthless.

One feature that Nesoid(nintendo) has that SNesoid does not is full screen mode.  The game won't be full screen, and I didn't even find the option to turn this on, but it does not take away from the awesome nostalgic experience that you are about to have.  With that said, the graphics are the EXACT SAME quality as the historic SNES.  The next question you may have, is "can I connect it via HDMI out to my TV" and that is a big whopping YES.  I do it all the time.  There are no tricks here for Xoom owners, just fire up SNesoid and connect your MICRO HDMI out to your TV.  You can sit on the couch, and play Super Nintendo on your TV and it is awesome.

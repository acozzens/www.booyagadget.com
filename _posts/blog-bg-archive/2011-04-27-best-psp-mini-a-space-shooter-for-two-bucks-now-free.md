For a two dollar shooter this game packs quite a big punch and will leave you very satisfied.  The game sports two different modes, a campaign mode and a survival mode. Either way you play the game the object is the same, KILL THE ALIENS.  While defeating the aliens you can earn money to upgrade your ship and make it alot easier to defeat the main bosses in the campaign.  Money gained in either mode can be used in either mode so it makes them both worth exploring.

You control Commander P. Jefferson's space ship on a quest to rid the galaxy of space aliens.  The game has some pretty decent cut-scenes for such a small download and while all the scenes are static, the dialogue is creative and enjoyable.

I really enjoyed this game and it feels like a great throwback to great space shooters of the past like Galaga.  For a quick view of some of the banter and gameplay check out our short video.  I think you will find that for PSN Plus Subscribers, this game is well worth it but it was even better when it was free. So watch the video, follow us on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/booyagadget){:target="_blank"} and go Blast Some Alien Scum!

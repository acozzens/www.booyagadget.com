 Right off the bat, I will tell you this case is not perfect, in fact, I give it 3.5 /5 stars.  **However, it absolutely does everything it says in the marketing hype**, it just doesn't do it all perfectly.  This case will protect your Xoom, and the stand does actually work great.  It does not make me tingle like my [Xoom's Arkon Folding Stand](/2011/04/best-xoom-accessories-arkon-portable-fold-up-stand-for-apple-ipad-galaxy-tab-blackberry-play-book.html), but it gets the job done.  Sniff around on your own, the other cases are not as good as this offering from Navitech. I paid $17 (+ shipping) and for that price this falls into the must-have / best Tablet accessory bucket !  I'm going to show you everything I can about this case-stand combo from Navitech with a writeup, flickr pics, and even a video so you can save or spend your money!

**The GOOD about this Case/Stand Combo:**

  * It's a case +1. It's a stand +1. It's BOTH a case AND a stand.. +1 !
  * Stand works well, optimized for landscape mode, this can actually display in portrait mode as well.
  * FRONT: "Holes in the Right Spots:  When open, you can charge, HDMI Out, plug in headphones etc.. No need to remove the Xoom to plug it in.
  * BACK:  Holes are pretty good in the back.  Mic is unimpeded, flash will work, and rear-camera "ok"
  * Bottom line is heavy photo/video Xoom users may get annoyed at slight adjustments / tweaks while case is in certain positions.
  * It is $17.. for multi-purpose protection and functionality.  That won't break any bank.
  * Yes, I WOULD recommend it to fellow Xoom Owners. Caveat-> if you don't use pic/video camera a LOT.
  * So far, it's the BEST in class.
  * Navitech's support was good, but it sucks that I needed to contact support ( late shipping )
  * Good Reviews ( from people that received the case )
  * I use the case exclusively now. ( but I keep my Arkon stand close by )

**The BAD:**

  * This is pig-skin leather, and is not soft and ain't "premium".  It literally needs to be broken in like a baseball glove.
  * Front Camera view is impeded by not-broken in leather.
  * This thing needs a button or velcro not a weak magnetic seal to keep it closed. I might even mod it myself, to help their engineer.
  * Navitech is having availability and shipping issues.
  * Most negative reviews are definitely based on shipping issues, but sucks they're having issues. Glad I got my case !

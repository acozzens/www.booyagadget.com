This **must-have accessory for your MacBook Pro utilizes the Mini display port and is "damn easy" to setup**.  I am going to tell you all about it in this article as well as a very detailed HD video that shows you EVERYTHING this awesome and affordable cable can do.

This accessory will show ANYTHING on your screen. That means photos, websites, Hulu, Netflix, iTunes, home Videos etc! At the end of the article, we show a video with a [full demonstration of this awesome MacBook accessory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vByAGTQERc){:target="_blank"}! Even if you don't think you need this, you should order it or pick it up from your local store. For $10 it's an awesome feature add for your expensive yuppy MacBook Pro, just like mine.

Read many other raving reviews ( avg 4.5 on Amazon) and buy an adapter on Amazon [they have new Amazon Basics Adapter](http://amzn.to/2q4Nrp3){:target="_blank"} that is very popular.

>Remember, if you only have DVI, you only get a VIDEO signal, so you'll need to run additional cables or connect with bluetooth for audio.  HDMI, however carries both signals.

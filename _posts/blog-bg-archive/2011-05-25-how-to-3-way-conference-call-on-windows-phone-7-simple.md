#### 3 EASY STEPS :  How to 3-way Conference Call on Windows Phone 7  
1. Make the first Call
2. After connected, press the DOWN ARROW key on the right of the screen and select **ADD CALL** 
  * This will place your first caller on hold, and allow you to make another call.
3. Dial your second call friend / co-worker. 
  * Once connected, press the DOWN ARROW KEY again and select **MERGE CALL!**

This also works to leave a harassing 2 person phone call on the 3rd member's voicemail like we did for our test ! Total Success, but more importantly a nice trick to know for your phone, and friggin easy as all hell.  BOOYA !

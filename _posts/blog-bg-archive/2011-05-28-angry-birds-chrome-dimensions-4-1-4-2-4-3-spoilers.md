If you are hungry for some new levels, then prepare to be satisfied! A nice extra touch is that I'm even playing Chrome Dimensions on my [Macbook Pro](/2011/05/must-have-accessories-macbook-pro-hdmi-out-to-samsung-tv.html) after having downloaded Chrome. Totally easy to setup, get new Angry Birds levels for FREE, and enjoy some new challenges.

So here's a short video with some music provided courtesy of ["The Swaybacks"](https://myspace.com/swaybacks){:target="_blank"} walking you through a 3 Star performances the first 3 levels of "Chrome Dimension" levels! They are actually quite tricky to get 3 stars on, took me a while. And this video should really help you save some time!

Comcast certainly does not spontaneously promote this because I assume their rental equipment is an additional profit center. I only purchased my own router about 3-4 months ago. But just like my rented modem, I haven't touched my [Motorola SB6120 Cable Modem since installation](http://amzn.to/2rYbhEv){:target="_blank"}!  From now on, I'm just saving money and you can too with a little elbow grease.

There is no magical power to the standard equipment Comcast/Xfinity pushes on you. My main recommendation, however, is that you do obtain equipment that maximizes your account features, and I strongly recommend that it resides on the COMCAST APPROVED MODEM LIST: [https://mydeviceinfo.xfinity.com/](https://mydeviceinfo.xfinity.com/){:target="_blank"}.

This is not an  attack on XFinity. I quite like their internet service. Booya Gadget is my hobby because I love tech, but by day I'm a technology professional and internet is very important to my financial well being. I tell you that so you understand my perspective.  I do NOT, however, like Comcast's cable TV offerings though, but that's another article.

**FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE ON RENTING YOUR EQUIPMENT**

  * You Pay Approximately $7 per month
  * $84 Rental Fees Per Year
  * $420 Rental Fees over 5 Years
  * The [Motorola SB6120 Cable Modem](http://amzn.to/2rYbhEv){:target="_blank"} I purchased cost $75 with free ( amazon prime member) shipping
  * Remember, I've been with Comcast for well over 10 years, but this basic principle applies to "most" Internet Service Providers.. Just "Google it" if you're not with Comcast.

##### BASIC INSTALL STEPS ( Comcast Specific )
1. Unplug all cables from old router  ( Set it aside, do not return until you are 100% comfortable, even I did this )
2. Read and apply any specific instructions provided in your modem documentation provided
3. Plug in Power, and Coax Cable to your purchased router
4. Plug in Ethernet Cable from the Modem to your computer or laptop
5. If you're with Comcast, you can send a signal by visiting:  <a title="Comcast Hardware Activation" href="http://www.comcast.com/activate" target="_blank">http://www.comcast.com/activate</a>
6. Once the modem has a signal, you can now plug it into your wireless router ( if applicable )
7. Enjoy not wasting $7 a month ever again.
8. If you decide to switch ISP or cancel for any reason, you can now  SELL the equipment you bought and help someone else save money !
9. Pay it forward. Recommend, and share your experience with others who might want to save a little money.
10. In the world's worst case scenario ever and nothing works, everything fails:  no problem, plug in your old equipment, return the purchased equipment. No harm, no Foul. However, I had a positive experience.

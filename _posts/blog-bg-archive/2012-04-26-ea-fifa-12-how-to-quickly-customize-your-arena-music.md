Assuming you already have some of your own music on your PS3 or XBox, it takes just a few minutes to customize and improve your game experience. For me, that arena song about drives me crazy having played hundreds of games. For this super-easy walkthrough I'm only adding music to the Arena & Menus of FIFA, I'd recommend you try this first it may be enough to satisfy you, you can add more customization later if you want.

Assumed step #1 is that already you have your own music on your PS3 or Xbox. For the absolute BEST results I recommend that organize your own tracks into a playlist so you don't play out your own favorites.

While I add every picture here and it may seem long, it's not, it just takes a few minutes and I HIGHLY recommend customizing your EA Experience by adding your own beats. You are rewarded with a Trophy/Achievement.

##### 1. Select Customise Fifa / My Music & Chants

##### 5. This is where you can select a single song from your console or a playlist(best) if you are setup with a custom playlist. I chose a single Track for the purpose of this article.

##### 6. Now you can see your own music, select the track(or playlist) that you'd like to play when generally in the arena, or even pre-game Pro Ranked Matches.

##### 7. The next option is to decide to apply your music selection to all events, or just the selected events. If you followed my pic, just select the single event so you can get a feel for where your custom FIFA music will be played, you can add more later.

##### 9. Once you've selected you track, it will take you back to the menu where you could apply your custom music to more events if desired. I find the "Arena & Menus" good enough, but feel free to customize even more from here..

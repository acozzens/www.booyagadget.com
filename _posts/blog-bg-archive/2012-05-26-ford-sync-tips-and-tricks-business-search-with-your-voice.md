In this article I'm going to walk you through a cool capability, finding local businesses using the "Business Search" commands. I actually do use this functionality on occasion and it's a lot faster and safer than pulling over on the road. In my case my Sync system is in a [2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid](https://www.flickr.com/photos/booyagadget/sets/72157627226613680/){:target="_blank"}.

Remember, to use the advance "Services" functionality, you MUST first register at [https://owner.ford.com/tools/account/sync-my-ride.html](https://owner.ford.com/tools/account/sync-my-ride.html){:target="_blank"}  ( have your VIN Ready )

##### KNOWN CITY STATE, KNOWN BUSINESS NAME

  1. SAY: "SERVICES"
  2. SAY: "BUSINESS SEARCH"
  3. SAY: "Renton Washington"
  4. SAY: "Cedar River Animal Hospital"
  5. SAY: "Directions"  ( sends address to your nav system )

##### SEARCH NEAR ME: KNOWN BUSINESS NAME

  1. SAY: "SERVICES"
  2. SAY: "BUSINESS SEARCH"
  3. SAY: "Search Near Me"
  4. SAY: "The Keg Steakhouse"
  5. SAY: "ONE" for the first option it offers you(closest)
  6. SAY: "CONNECT ME" ( dials phone number from your car )

##### SEARCH NEAR ME: FIND A GAS STATION

  1. SAY: "SERVICES"
  2. SAY: "BUSINESS SEARCH"
  3. SAY: "Search Near Me"
  4. SAY: "Gas Stations" ( searching by Type of Business )
  5. SAY: "ONE" for the first option it offers you(closest)
  * SAY: "Text me the info" ( send address to your phone via text)
  * SAY: "Driving Directions" ( sends address to your nav system )

##### OTHER OPTIONS / INFO

  * "Search Near Me"  ( finds locations near you if unknown )
  * "connect me" dials phone number.
  * "text me the info" Send you a txt message to your phone with Link & Phone to your location ( good for forwarding to friends )
  * It remembers your last search.. you'd say: "Last Search" if you need to remember the last search you did.
  * If you're low on gas, the nav will auto populate nearest fuel stations on your screen.

This is easy and convienient, it has come in handy for me a handful of times already!

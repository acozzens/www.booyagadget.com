First of all, congrats if you own the very nice Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Ice Cream Sandwich. I purchased mine from the Google Play Store back in the day, as this an old article. Regardless, read on to easily learn how to screen cap.

##### HOW TO SCREEN CAPTURE SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS  
* Press and hold the VOLUME DOWN AND POWER buttons simultaneously for about 1 second.
* The phone will beep, and the screen will simulate a photo snapshot.  You will also see a message and icon in the notification bar.

##### HOW TO ACCESS IMAGES SAVED BY SCREEN CAPTURE ON THE GALAXY NEXUS  
* The Pics are located in the SDCard/Pictures/Screenshots Folder.
* You can browse the images using the "Gallery" app, from the top notification bar, or download the popular free app [ES File Explorer from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop){:target="_blank"}.
* COOL BONUS: On Galaxy Nexus, screen captured images are able to be auto-uploaded to [Dropbox](https://db.tt/yPwcBzWr){:target="_blank"} if you'd like, this is very very handy for my screenshot purposes.

Congrats if you own the very nice [T-Mobile Galaxy S2 Android](http://amzn.to/2sShD8v){:target="_blank"}! It's a great phone, but I don't like their flavor of Ice Cream Sandwich. When it comes to screen capture on your Galaxy S2, it's pretty easy on this device and does not require root access.

##### HOW TO SCREEN CAPTURE WITH T-MOBILE GALAXY S2 (T989)
* Quickly Press and Release the HOME AND POWER buttons simultaneously.
* The screen will blink and you will get a message indicating success: "_Screen Captured. Saved as Image File_"
* It's a quirky key-combo because Power is a physical button while Home is a touch button.
* You cannot Screen Capture while your device is plugged in via USB AND Connected as USB Storage.  ( It's OK To plugin while screen capturing, but disable USB Storage Mode if you have it enabled. )

##### HOW TO ACCESS IMAGES SAVED BY SCREEN CAPTURE ON THE GS2  
* The Pics are sent to your phone's base folder level  into the "ScreenCapture" Folder.
* You can browse the images using the "Gallery" app, from the top notification bar, or download the popular free app [ES File Explorer from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop){:target="_blank"}.

Your goal is to wipeout civilization by infecting a single country with one of six different plagues:  Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Prion, Nano-Virus, and finally the Bio-Weapon. Make the plague spread and try to slow down the scientists out to stop your gaming fun.

I was able to eventually start cruising through all the plagues but I sure got stuck on the FUNGUS Level for way too long! Depending on what you like, this game is definitely worth a dollar and works on BOTH iPad and iPhone. It can get a little redundant, but the way to overcome that is to apply the endless amount of different strategies to take out the world.

##### How to take out the World with Fungus:

The basic strategy is this: infect the world without them knowing it. Have patience and double the game speed. Continue to collect your DNA points and transmissions WILL occur (but slowly). Your disgusting Fungus will continue unstopped as long as humans don't know they have the infection. So immediately de-evolve all auto symptoms!  Once everyone is infected, CRANK UP the symptoms. Total Organ Failure is a solid choice of symptoms but you can choose whatever as long as you make it extreme. You'll want to have about 60-70 DNA Points once the entire world is infected.

	<figcaption>Infect the world Symptom Free, Everyone is infected but ZERO DEATHS. THEN CRANK UP THE SYMPTOMS with your 60-77 DNA Points. VOILA</figcaption>

**For FUNGUS TRANSMISSION:**I just cranked 2-3 levels of Air and Water. Way Later on, you'll start getting some bonus DNA Points, you can use them on transmission, symptoms, or abilities.

**For FUNGUS SYMPTOMS**:  IMMEDIATELY De-Evolve any automatic mutations that occur.

**For FUNGUS ABILITIES**:  I pretty much cranked up drug resistance abilities to slow down scientists. But they won't have time to cure it anyways :) MUUUAHAHAHA you evil bastard!!

Here you go, the \*\*SPOILER\*\* for [Sega Total War Battles](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/total-war-battles/id499885330?mt=8){:target="_blank"}  "Dust Before The Wind" level for the iPad and iPhone.</a>  This level is pretty far into the game, and at this point I knew the key was placement of the provided lumber yards. The goal here is to collect 950 wood in 8 minutes. It's not too hard once you know how and where to place the Lumber Yards. After that you simply need to protect them. Great strategy game for the iPad and iPhone.

#### STEP 1 QUICKLY layout the required buildings and Place the 5 Provided Lumber Yards as shown in the picture.

#### Step 2:  Now simply defend with (non wood) costing infantry. I use Matchlock Riflemen and basic Ronin Swordsmen. Place the riflemen 1 Hex Behind the swordsmen so they can still fire. (Devastating!) Replenish, Slay Them All, and Sustain are good General's orders to queue up.

	<figcaption>Once you place the lumber yards (QUICKLY) immediately start creating (non-wood) costing soldiers and start queuing Generals Orders. With Riflemen right behind them, any swordsmen will mow down enemies.</figcaption>

#### Step 3:  Make sure to collect your wood and smile as you easily pass this level and move on while collecting another 400 Experience Points to spend on your clan's efficiency!  BOOYA !

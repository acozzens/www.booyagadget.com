 If you only want to factory reset, but keep your Touch or Paperwhite, then skip to step 2.  But if you're looking to transfer ownership in some way then you MUST perform steps 1 and 2.

##### Step 1 and Most importantly:  DE-REGISTER YOUR DEVICE

To transfer ownership, you have to de-register from Amazon.  If you don't, then the new owner won't be able to use the Kindle.

From the Home Screen select  MENU / SETTINGS / REGISTRATION
  
This will give you the option to DeRegister your Kindle right there.

You can also sign-in and de-register your [Kindle (here) on the Amazon website](https://www.amazon.com/mycd){:target="_blank"}, it will be listed under Manage Devices / Manage my Kindle.

##### KINDLE TOUCH CRAIGSLIST SELLING TIP

Some buyers on craigslist were nervous because they even asked me "can I register it to my account?".  Apparently there are scammers and thieves with stolen Kindles and were blocked by Amazon.  So when I sold mine recently here on Oahu,  I just brought my phone, shared my wifi and let the new owner register it before he left, which eased all fear.  I recommend doing that if you have the setup.

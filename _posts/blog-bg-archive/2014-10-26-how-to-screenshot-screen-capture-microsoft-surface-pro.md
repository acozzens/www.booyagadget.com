I hope your enjoying your Microsoft Surface tablet / laptop hybrid. I've owned and used the RT, Surface Pro 2, and now the Surface Pro 3 core i7 model. There are a thousand reasons you may need to screenshot or screen cap from your Surface gadget. Here are 2 easy, built-in ways to capture your screen.

These 2 methods have worked on all my Surface gadgets.

#### METHOD 1 TO SCREEN CAP SURFACE PRO (2 on tablet presses)

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Press and hold</span> the "capacitive"  Windows button on the front of your Surface Screen(on the bezel) with your right hand.
2. Continue holding the windows button and then a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">single press the Volume Down button</span> with your left hand.

The screen will go slightly dim for a just a quick moment when you've done it right.

#### METHOD 2 TO CAPTURE SCREENSHOT SURFACE PRO ( Keyboard 3 key-combo )

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Press and hold</span> the windows Key(left hand), and the Fn(function) Key(right Hand), then just tap the space bar with your favorite 3rd finger or thumb.

#### WHERE ARE SCREENSHOTS SAVED ?** 

**The Screenshot will be saved in This PC > Pictures > Screenshots.. AKA  C:\Users\*\*YOU\**\Pictures\Screenshots**

If you're a dropbox user, you can enable a setting that will also copy the screenshot to your clip board, which can be handy(when applicable). If you're not a dropbox user, you should consider finally [signing up here.](https://db.tt/rgLAKoVg){:target="_blank"}

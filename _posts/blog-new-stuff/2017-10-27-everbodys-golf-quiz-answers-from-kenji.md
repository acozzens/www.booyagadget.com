Based on my experience, I recommend just using this guide to answer the questions. Here's why!  It takes forever to re-take the quiz as there's no shortcuts. I made the additional mistake of smashing X button to skip annoying dialogue when re-taking a quiz. So, I ended up incorrectly answering a question (thus failing the quiz) and having to start over. ugh.  So just make sure you get it right the first time.

The first question I missed was What do you call the place where you take a tee shot?.  I've simply never heard it called a "teeing ground" before, I simply call it the Tee-Box, which wasn't an option. Whoops.

Here are the questions and answers:
